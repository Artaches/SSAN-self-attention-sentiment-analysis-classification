...copied from apple﻿
I've owned buggy android devices. My anecdote defeats yours,﻿
As Android user, I must admit,﻿ that iPad is way better than this. (my opinion is based on ad, reviews, screenshots, etc)
It works fine for﻿ me, I just love how small it is, sadly without Honeycomb :(
Steve jobs﻿ came here too﻿ ;)
I remember when you﻿ said how many videos I had posted comments on stating the FACT that Apple is much, much better than the shitty-plastic-choppy-complete-copies-of-Apple's-ideas-competition. Well, guess what. I have seen even MORE of your fucking retarded ignorant comments, ALL of which are ripping Apple, which is pretty much certainly the ONLY innovative company on planet Earth, EVERY other single company copies Apple, you stupid retarded piece of shit SAMSUNG FANBOY. If you reply, I won't!!!!
Samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1 3﻿
Except or the 500$ price, it﻿ looks like a great device. Will be amazing for 300$ (w/o the stylet).
Asus transformer is﻿ better than this.
for $99﻿ I would buy it for myself ;)
Only one word for this.....R.U.B.B.I.S.H!! ﻿ Get Samsung Galaxy Tab instead, runs rings around this shit.
I'm not sure if it helps now but if I were﻿ you I would get the Playbook
The samsung galaxy tab tataly kills the htc flyer﻿
Awesome (asides from battery life)﻿
Very informative﻿ video. I finally got my Asus EP121. I noticed that in your video, you used stylus pen to write and your fingers for windows gestures (like scrolling the doc up and down). But on my EP121, when I write using stylus (say on OneNote) my hand/palm also writes on the screen. This is interfering my writing with stylus. And I cannot use my fingers to scroll like you showed. How can I disable writing with hand/finger/palm while I am writing with stylus?
Further to my previous question, I know I can disable hand gesture and writing through control panel. But that is bit time consuming as I need to enable and disable﻿ every time. All I want is to write with Stylus with out my palm scrabbling rubbish on the screen and at the same time be able to use fingers to make gesture commands.
Best tablet reviews around. Could you please elaborate as to whether there﻿ is input lag during inking?
Not﻿ for 99% of applications. If you use a heavy duty complicated brush in photoshop you might find some lag. Applications that are well written do not lag at all.
Yes, you could buy it instead of a PC, although personally I would prefer it to have a docking station for that purpose. Really battery use time is about 3 - 3.5 hours (they claim up to 4.5 which is possible, but not realistic) and boot up time for a clean PC is quick enough﻿ to be not worth worrying about since you should only need to do it once every few weeks (use standby or hibernate).
12" is great, but makes it a bit heavier and power hungry than it could be. Yes it does come with Active Digitiser Pen and keyboard. Sorry, but can't do Photoshop or gaming video﻿ as I don't do either.
(1) OneNote is perfect. (2) is a computer, (a) HDMI out (b) OneNote is perfect. Look at this ASUS, Fujitsu Q550 or Motion CL900. Don't want to spend﻿ a fortune, or don't want to save / make a fortune? You choose!
i hope things like this going﻿ to be cheaper in future, because now i rather buy laptop than tablet with laptop hardware
The Windows Tablet PC is dead. Even﻿ Microsoft has abandoned it and has shifted to copying the iPad like everybody else. The iPad has proven that the tablet form factor requires a completely new, industry changing OS. Let it go. It's DOA.
Using mine right now! :) Personally I use it to sketch roughs for work in PS CS4 so I kinda feel like the side market for this tablet, the artist. It even runs zBrush very well but it's no desktop or Cintiq just a pretty powerful slate computer. Just want to point out you really need to turn down the win 7 features and power save modes and screen brightness if you want to last past the 3 hr mark﻿ on the battery.
I bought it, installed windows 8 developers preview with USB and went the installation completely in touch, everything is supported except bluetooth (install driver seperately). I notice in windows8, there is improvement in the 3d acceleration. The virtual keyboard is the best i've ever typed﻿ on. It's so responsive and has a nice muffle tapping sound. I can type very fast because of the new layout.
Try the newer Samsung Series 7 Slate which has a docking﻿ station.
Not on this one. If you need a longer battery life check out some alternatives like the Samsung Series 7 Slate (Home / Executive use -﻿ 4.5 - 5 hours) or the Motion Computing J3500 and F5v (Rugged field use, hot swappable batteries). Functionally these tablets are all identical. The difference is in the form factor.
Depends a lot on you and what you want a tablet to do... Samsung S7S is smaller and lighter with better battery life. It also has a "Sandy Bridge" Intel Core i5 which is newer than the Asus. On the other hand the Asus has a bigger screen and much better colour reproduction. A number of my customers have also perceived it﻿ to be quicker than the Samsung although technically it shouldn't be. Tell me more about what's important to you and I can advise you better,
Both will do fine, but I would lean towards the Samsung for better battery life and smaller size. Be sure﻿ to get the Samsung Stand Case also.
J3500 has removable batteries,﻿ better battery life, vehicle and desktop docking options and the Gorilla Glass version is better outside. It's heavier though, but rugged. That's the quick comparison...
This tablet PC is the computer's industry's version of the series "Firefly". It's brilliant, superior to the competition, but poorly marketed. I just hope it doesn't meet the same end one day, and Apple/Android﻿ zombies don't take over the world.
Correct on battery life. No 3G for this tablet though. Try the Samsung Series﻿ 7 Slate.
only 2-3﻿ hours!?
Yes, not great battery life on this one. This years windows tablets (the good ones with an Intel Core i5) will get﻿ up to 6 to 10 hours, but with 2 hour charge times (not 5 like ipad).
Fujitsu Q702, Samsung Series 7﻿ Slate (ATIV), both with very nice, strong detachable keyboard docks.
ipad has 10 hour battery life, lol, or﻿ more
Great! 10 hours of not doing much plus 5 hours to charge. I guess it all depends on how you value your time. The new Fujitsu Q702 can go 10 hours as﻿ can many oter newer Windows tablets running real productivity software, not poor excuses.
and to wrap it up. my ipad fits all my needs. email, word processing, checking school things, and even file management since i'm no noob. yes of course windows is﻿ SO much more versatile, but it does a little more than i need it to do for school, so i thought 10 hours of doing exactly what i need, beats 3-4 hours of endless possibilities that i won't bother getting to. ipads aren't bad at all when youre tech-literate.
I love this device but dude, it actually does say $ 9,000﻿ for this device on Amazon lol
Too bad the batteries of the future that﻿ would allow such a great windows tablet to run at least 10 hours aren't here yet, ipad and all those android tablets would bite the dust immediately!
hhmmmm, LTE - $80.00, UPDATED CAMERA - $175.00, OVERCLOCKED GPU -﻿ 125.00 AND A NICER SCREEN - $120.00, its official im paying for updates every 6 - 8 months, i may need to take a loan in the coming 7 months to upgrade to iphone 5
one thing i can give apple is that they know how to run there business. ya there should have been a quad core instead of an over clocked 2 core but u have to think, not all of apples apps are optimized to run on 2 cores so another 2 cores wont change much. the ipad pretty much runs on nothing but apps and with out flash those 2 cores are enough for now. i can live with a shitty back camera but they should have given us an HD﻿ front facing camera. thats what im angry about and siri.
I personally want to see some SIGNIFICANT improvement rather than﻿ some slight surface enhancements to the iOS experience. This is what Apple continually does to make as much profit from consumers as possible, and it annoys me.
Nice thing. Too bad its﻿ so expensive..
Too expensive. I really want﻿ one!!~
APPLE SUCKS﻿
Thanks for your Comment. Could you explain to us what you don`t like about Apple? I`m pretty sure the﻿ Community would like to know what could be the Reason why some People don`t enjoy Apple Products to change that in the upcoming future.
wtf is this....stupid piece of junk that brainwashed people will buy...Most people have no need for such a﻿ product...
I did not dislike it but i dont see why﻿ would i buy a giant iphone?
still not getting this I rather have my laptop﻿
Hm... :/ why should i buy this..? In a few﻿ years there comes a new iXY anyway
I can say that again﻿ if you want. You are completely full of shit You are completely full of shit You are completely full of shit You are completely full of shit You are completely full of shit And I can still say, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, the new iPad is shit, No more characters left sorry
iPAD 3 just boring ! Apple is becoming so boring lately, I like better the﻿ aggressive new android devices as design and innovation.
you can just use apples shit to connect you to other devices. You even can't use Bluetooth to share your pictures or music. The reason of this technical difficulties is the software "i-tunes" and forbid you to use other better options. And because apple don't have flash, you can't use the whole internet.Well, thats not all the facts, but I haven't got enough time to list them all, and I hope you to understand my﻿ oppinion. ;)(sorry for my bad englisch, I'm german!)
@touchgameplay Yes, I would like to tell you the reasons. At first, apple takes too much money for these crap with an scruffy apple on the backside. All the chinese workers must work hardly under bad conditions for the super-revenues of that fucking affiliated group. Than the hardware: when an I-crap falls on the groand, it will be totaly broken.﻿ Now I tell you facts about the software. Using an I-product, you are in an virtual cage: (look at the next post...)
So they add the Retina Display, a better camera and a new﻿ chip. Somehow, that's "revolutionary" to Apple... The only reason to buy an iPad is the software support for us Mac users. Otherwise, other tablets are stronger faster and cheaper.
I dislike Apple only because of their prices, also they release a new device every few months for no﻿ other reason than to make more money.
Cool an ipad... wait we have no more stream or ddl usefullness ﻿
I don't get it. Apple make a new ipad once a year. A new iphone once a year. And not even all Macs get a new iteration every year; only like macbook air and macbook pro. The Mac Pro has remained unchanged for almost 2 years. I don't understand﻿ how that is "release a new device every few months for no other reason than to make more money"
I still﻿ miss USB on IPad :(
will they ever put a good camera on these﻿ things
I dumped my iphone and ipad for samsung gs2 and galaxy tab 10.1 and there is no turning back to apple any time soon. Apple products have so much hype. Apple devices are bare bones running software that has to﻿ work with the bare bones. Put live widgets and a live wall paper on a ipad or iphone and then the barebones will have trouble running it smoothly. Android has live widgets and livewallpapers which have challenges but the phones and tablets are just as smooth as any iphone or ipad.
I asus prime has a﻿ 8megapixel camera with a flash which take awesome pictures. The camera on the asus is just as good as the over hyped apple newipad camera.
How would you know if this creams any windows 8 tablets when the tablets are not out﻿ yet. Come on get out of the apple dome like i did a year ago. I am bored with apples hardware and ios and the daycare apple provides.
Keep your﻿ iPad 2
yeah all thats cool in all but i love my ipad 2...now awnser me one thing can it play flash? prob not so whats﻿ better about it more high def cool what else its faster so... my ipad 2 already loads instantly and they display is amazing. if it can play flash ill consider it but if not then who cares its just something they hype up again and say its revolutionizing everything when its just a glorified ipad 1 or 2
Ipad=no flash. Buy﻿ a laptop
No flash﻿
Lesbehonest Everybody! Nobody really uses an Ipad as you see in Commericals or Trailers; You just don't... All you do is Internet, Games﻿ & Pictures... Books, Video Editing, Photo Editing, iCloud & iMessage are things to suck up people into buy these product and the Truth is..nobody barely even uses those Apps...
Big Iphone﻿ 2 ???
Actually, its you that does not have a clue what you're talking about. iOS does not support flash and it never will. Therefore Safari needs to open up a different state where it will play the video; it cannot play it on the webpage itself. Yes"third party converter app" is, I admit a bit too far fetched when explaining that but the fact remains that you cannot play flash on the page itself. No I had an iPhone 4S and the process is pretty much﻿ the same.
Just like the fact remains that even though Adobe stopped core development of flash, that doesnt make flash "stone age technology" Flash is also the greater part of Youtube. That is the argument here. There are entire flash based sites on the web that will not be rendered on your iPad without flash. Understand this. For a full web browsing experience, Flash is necessary. Just so you know,﻿ if it wasnt for Google's HTML5 compatibilty you wouldnt even be able to use Youtube ;)
Watch them have real widgets, navigation and swiping keyboards next. The new Google Play is also awesome! The screen looks nice, other than that face it, Apple is not that innovating anymore, fell behind and copied some Android features! The new﻿ Prime for me :) 1080P screen should be fine. lol
It's not crap (anyone﻿ who says that is an idiot or a little kid) but their innovation days are not as bright as they used to be. They are falling behind on the OS and devices to Android because of their stubborn ways and the way they provide "daycare" to its customers. Btw, not the thinnest device, cloud was on Android first, same with widgets, navigation, voice input (recognition better than Siri), most new apps are in both stores, find my device was Android first (Wavesecure).
So you really have to wonder how Android became such a big competitor only in a couple of years and has some﻿ stuff that Apple devices and OS never will because of their messed up ways. That's what bugs me the most about Apple; it could be so much better and I think it's the only way forward for them cause Android and eventually Windows Phone will put it in its place if not. It's already started and you can really notice it. Look up Google Play -> ideology Apple needs!
The new iPad has seriously not that great specs. Same CPU as the iPad 2, same kind of GPU, but with 4 cores instead of 2. 4 times the pixels. Do the math, the new iPad should be a bit slower/choppier than the iPad 2. Games will look better due to the screen, but the graphics will not be improved. I'm not saying that the new iPad is bad, it's just not﻿ as fantastic as many fanboys are saying it is. Nevertheless, I'm actually buying this iPad. The screen is mind-blowing!
lol, or just get an Android tablet with a micro usb port and micro sd card slot.. lol. They are just as smooth and do even more. That's the whole point. I don't understand why people still buy these things. My guess is because Apple marketing is very﻿ good.
You can hook up say﻿ a 2.5" terabyte hard drive to the micro-USB port.. and add a 64Gb micro-SD card to most Android tablets. They also cost a little bit less usually but I guess not that much less anymore.
wow.. I just realized that on iOS you can't change your default software for anything!! :S Like installing﻿ Winamp instead of iTunes or Chrome or Firefox instead of Safari browser or a different phone dialer or SMS program. I won't even talk about different home replacements with crazy effects, extra widgets and a myriad of customizable features. In Android you can and I guess I took it for granted..
GPU on the Transformer Prime has 12 cores with a 4 core cpu... soooo... it's marketing hype to pull people in.﻿
You have to agree they know how to hype up their products. That's why people will give them their money. Where is a good camera, Flash, usb port, micro sd card, choice of widgets instead of scrolling icons, Swype keyboard, Google navigation﻿ (standalone gps style), better maps? They now have a notification bar, a﻿ cloud, some widgets and voice input on the keyboard, which were Android only features until not long ago. I like having more choice of what my device looks like and what I put on it.
It still doesn't have flash... It still costs 500$..... When will apple realise that we do not need a new camera?!!!! The resolution is so fucking good but do we really need it?? Also it has been the same design since the﻿ begining!!! and yet people still buy this shit... wtf people??
There are lots of tools for Android that do iOS things such as Vlingo for Siri. They are still not a native OS application. They are also not﻿ as refined as say Google Navigation which receives updates every week pretty much. OS native features tend to be more solid. Apple has good software and devices but their closed minded mentality is what bugs me. I guess it's for money and that's what companies care about; they exist just to make a profit in the end and they're doing that.
You can use Android to upload straight to the cloud as well. Even dropbox offers that. :) The problem arises when you have a few HD movies 4-5 Gb each or very large files you want to store﻿ temporarily. If you don't have those worries yes, I agree with you that it's not needed. The cloud can't handle many Gb of data yet though. And think of the bandwidth consumption while storage is fairly cheap.
lol, thanks for that. Of course the Apple and Amazon stores are better. They are more matured software while Google Market is just coming out of its infancy. It will take time to develop and for Google to learn what works well and what﻿ doesn't. 7 years versus 2. Also Apple has world class marketing so even old people know of the itunes store. That's how they have the sales numbers they do. Android is nowhere near the same level and may never be cause the iTunes lead is too big.
Most new Appz aren`t on both Stores since the current ideology of the Android Community is sadly what still not really that of an adult. Publisher like Gameloft/Electronic Arts/... do release more Pay2Play Content for the iOS/Kindle then for the Android Market Place so you should clearly ask yourself why it`s that Way and﻿ not the opposite. While the Android Market is sure huge you see more Developer dropping out of it since the current net profit is not big enough to survive it.
p.s. You veered far from the point. lol. I don't usually post replies; it was kinda fun but feels like wasted time when I could do something useful. All I have to say is that Android has caught up fast to a mature OS and because it's open source I prefer it over the Apple jail and dated UI (yes, I became biased). I also like having my choice of handsets/tablets, which is a pretty big deal. You like﻿ the other way and that's ok; it's by no means a bad choice.
Flash is﻿ your problem? Thats why people recommend you to buy android tablets
Android all﻿ the way.
This is great only if mr jobs could hold and﻿ see this :(
Apple sucks go buy a real﻿ tablet samsung!
That sheit looks just the same as the﻿ others go get a real tablet samsujg
Android is so﻿ much better;)
The iPad sucks the windows 8 tablet will﻿ let you do ever thing you can do on your pc, because it's the same software, you can even play the real minecraft and mod it. Plus you can download any software off the web like photo shop. And it still has apps
ANDROID﻿ AND WINDOWS FTW!
Android sucks for games,music,lags like a mofo, viruses, feels cheap and customizing is useless. And i bought the new asus transformer prime. Should of got this﻿ instead -.-
Android 4﻿ ever!!
IPad 2﻿ :)
Good﻿ products but seriously., I'm just gonna wait till June when the iPad 16 comes out.
There are no more security concerns with iOS than there are with Android and ICS is awesome on a tablet btw. Honeycomb was less refined yes. Notice how each iteration advances so much as to﻿ give iOS (a 7 year old OS that still has scrolling rows of icons) a serious run for its money. There is a concern for all the Google manages info, but since iOS has a cloud now too you'll have the same thing. We have had a cloud as of ~ 2 years ago and the info has been fine so far.
Sure there are not as many Games for the Android Platform as for the iOS One but there are still a few Great Games for the Android too. I even got my Samsung Tablet because﻿ of some Games that do launch on the Android Platform earlier then on the iOS so that should tell you that there are enough Games for both Platforms to make it worth getting One.
We will have to see how things will move along but as far as I can trust﻿ the Sell Stats iOS/Android do indeed Own the Market currently :D
That's because Apple is not a technology developing company, it's a marketing company in large :P:). Very good at it but still. Everything else besides the OS is made by another company such as Samsung﻿ and Foxconn
Looks to me like an ipad 2 update, not worth going from the ipad 2 to this one, However if you like﻿ wasting money go ahead :)
So its like an ipad 2 witg﻿ new cool stuff Nice job though.. But u guys make new products too much with lil change
Plz tell me I'm not the only one that thinks the improvements are not as big as they﻿ make out to be
lol. it's called open source. You can already get ICS for most devices you just have to know what you're doing. If it was Apple it would be completely different. It's a trade-off between having more choice of devices and getting updates later on. I have a Galaxy Nexus and I get updates right away. The phone also can't be locked to one carrier :P :)﻿
I have been around technology about 15 years and am a systems and computing engineer (hardware, software, mechatronics and electronics). Also proficient in advanced programming :P:) lol, ICS Android is very﻿ smooth. You probably used Android in its infancy. Why iOS is smooth is because of openGL hardware acceleration which is not present in Android. My Galaxy Nexus is butter smooth and can do real multitasking instead of asking for time from the CPU.. lol
Also that it looks like a million bucks is subjective. I think it looks antiquated with its scrolling icons (in Android that is the app drawer) and no options of real widgets which are very nice to have btw. I commend you for using all those OS and device combinations but iOS is if anything now comparable to Android but is lagging behind in many respects. One of those is UI, where iOS used to be﻿ king. Times change.. :)
The vast majority of the new Android handsets run very well. They respond very fast and run smoothly. You might be a bit behind the times. There will be some that are slower but that's an extra choice for people that can't afford a really high end﻿ smartphone and by no means a bad option. Choice is a good thing.
Looks pretty﻿ bad. Why would anyone want a tablet? lol
Apple, I love you to death, but FU in the face for not including﻿ this on the IPAD 2!
Yes, I'm cheap. I'M NOT AS FUCKING RICH AS YOU. It's hard to earn money. Why would I buy something that I don't really need? How﻿ about saying that to those people who are currently dreaming on having that device and on which they can never afford throughout their lifetime, then call them "cheap".
Why the heck are﻿ they calling it retina display?? It's not even 270ppi..
So the last ipad didn't even have retina?! Fucking GAY.﻿
People expect to much from technology, if technology﻿ moved this quick there would be no point of buying anything cause there will be something much better in the near future.
why the hell﻿ doesn't have a better camera?
Well if next year there﻿ is a better iPad, (4th year of the iPad) then in 2017 there is gonna be one even BETTER, why buy it, wait till 2017!
i would not buy it if you got﻿ the ipad 2 ,because it's almost the same thing(just nem camera,hardware,and retina)
I don't think Apple﻿ should be calling the New iPad has retina display...becoz it has only 264ppi a display that goes beyond 300ppi threshold mark is only called as a retina display.
Apple its not inovating anymore they just justifin why we must buy another product whit the same features as the old one but just newer and still whitout﻿ flash support
Also they dont make nothin they just subcontract other companies for making all the parts ,more﻿ like a home brand
Lame improvements ... Apple has not suprised anyone for a long time. This product was predictable,﻿ also for the competitors, so the competitors have the upper hand. Sadly, after Steve Jobs's death, Apple is lost and this would be the right time to sell Apple shares away ...
STEVE JOBS SAID,﻿ "Father", forgive﻿ them, for they don't know what they are doing with apple.
Without steve jobs, apple getting﻿ worst :'( sry but i hope iphone5 will better than the iPad3
lol at 3:20, definitely photoshopped. look at the pic after taking and the one that﻿ appears right after. but than again. you dun get an ipad for its camera.
haiz..hope the apple next generation will find a better innovation to makes the world shock..... just﻿ the way when they was introducing iphone .."
Too bad I can't afford it. I wish Apple﻿ would make cheaper stuff.
This is madness....they have brought out ANOTHER ipad with a better chip, screen and camera? So another 100 million ipads made, 100﻿ million boxes, 100 millions sets of cables what a complete waste of resources! I cant imagine what the world will be like in 100 years....
i don't get it, i don't see anything innovative, still a dual core cpu, same design ?!?! EXPENSIVE. the only thing they added to iPad was the resolution and i admit﻿ that this is cool..but they are late with technology, if they wanted to make it outstanding they should put a quad core, a different design, a different looking os this new ipad is like iphone 4s...a disappoint
F U APPLE.﻿
over expensive, non updatable, marketing scam﻿
work on the fuckin camera :/﻿
Apple is just milking people out of their money. "The new ipad" Lol,apple should just stop. Not that their products are horrible,but they have the worst marketing strategy﻿ ever. I own an ipod touch 4g,but i still love android. They release the same exact thing every year. When will this change?
apple is retard.. instead of giving﻿ it the name they just call it the new ipad.. and now we finally have 4g products in holland.. yay! :D kidding, i hope that it takes a long time before we get 4g because its distorts massively on digital television.
If it had siri and they'd called it iPad 3 and﻿ wait a little longer for it to come out everyone would be happy.
Things I`m expecting from the next iPad: - Faster HDD - Faster CPU - Faster GPU I haven`t put Siri on that List since I strangle don`t feel the need to talk with my Tablet... Maybe I will change my Mind if Apple will put it finally on their Tablet.﻿ Till then I really don`t care as that much about it.
At least samsung thinks outside the box as where apple just uses the same exact UI,but just changes to the internal specs.the ipod touch 3g and 4th gen,same exact thing except the ipod touch 4g has a better processor than the 3g. Instead of google choosing HTC to make another google phone they chose samsung which is one of the best﻿ companies for making android devices. Plus android is open source and google isn't a bunch of hustlers like apple. Apple takes 30% of app makers money,google doesn't.
"The new﻿ ipad" worse name ever for a device
no﻿ siri??
Why you mad? LOL. Calling me a retard for stating my opinion...you got know it all don't ya? I'm not saying apples products suck,but they're just the same thing every time. Which is getting old. Idk if you mean runs android as in hardware compatible to run﻿ android or owns android. But in terms of who legally owns android,It's google. Correct me if I'm wrong.
*sigh*, same device, new screen, new camera and a modified processor, apple are losing their﻿ touch.
It sounds nice in the video but when u buy it, no difference, and hd games﻿ are like 5 dollars, and at least let the app store have themes. I love cydia.
I love apple more than any tablets out their..though apple is not likely changing the looks of their products, but still they are the first one to build a gadget that others will surely follow..like the iPAD, it is the very first tablet that was made, and so when other makers of gadget saw﻿ it, they came up with their own tablets. In reality, apple is always the first in all gadgets.
e. Shut up? Dude if you would've read all the comments I said apples marketing and iOS is getting old. Apple is doing good I can't lie. But they're starting to lack in many things. I own a iPod touch and my phone﻿ is android. So I do support iOS,but they need to bring something new to the table. Android has variety which is what I'm about. Apple has quantity which is okay to i guess.
THANK YOU! I too support apple but its getting old to me which is why I bought the epic 4g touch! I had an iPhone 4s but I'm bored of iOS. The epic 4g touch is my first﻿ android phone. Much better than the 4s.
Well, actually I think Bill Gates came up with a﻿ tablet way before than apple did :/ but nobody paid attention then,
This commercial looks exactly the same as the ipad 2. its funny when you watch the same video, but for the "older"﻿ generation product. You can point out where the "new" ipad improved, and then ask yourself when watching this video and ask "Why didn't they do that in the ipad 2?"
an atenna﻿ for 3G or 4G LTE. they dont have it on Wi-Fi ipads
its not that the﻿ new ipad sucks but i mean common throughout the entire video u talking about little marginal improvement, that other tablets have done for almost a year now the new display is great but as for the other parts the 4g wireless is on every device and lets get really realistic u will not realistically every gonna use the camera dont really dislike the new ipad but the promo is like the typical apple bullshit
but HTC﻿ suck....
Im an avid Apple user, and I absolutely adore my Ipad, but it really was a huge mistake for Jobs to not even include a stinking manual... Now let﻿ me say I am IMMENSELY tech savvy, and do everything from scripting, design, to hardware repair. But this site I stumbled upon literally showed me things I would have NEVER even known were possible with my Ipad. Do yourself a favor and check it out, it's well worth your time: everyipadsecret.info
Meanwhile in China...The average monthly salaries for the workers who make iPhones and iPads is around $358! They work over 60 hours a week and sometimes all 7 days of a week! They work in aluminium dust which is﻿ a big problem on the factories because it has resulted that there have been many explosions in the factories which produces those fine aluminium skin for the iPhones and iPads!! I hope that they will get a free new ipad...BUT WAIT! Then theyre just get punished even more!
If you did get an ipad 2, don't worry its only bad to those who wanted the new retina display... the A5x chip is a graphic enhancement and other than that its pretty much the same to﻿ me... it still doesn't run Logic...
I have iPad 2 should I buy the new iPad or w8﻿ till next year I really want to buy one there's a lot people put me off it because there is so many problems and some of you say IPad 2 is still better
Not to great as apple made﻿ some tablet before.
I like how it didnt﻿ mention that its thicker, heavier and heats up a lot faster and that multi tasking on this iPad kills the battery faster than the 2nd generation iPad.
I never owned an Ipad or any Apple product and I'm never going﻿ to own one of their products until Apple creates a device that will beam a laser from space that will scratch my ass. Because I can find that moderate useful but for now I will continue to use Ipads and Iphones as drink coasters and a cutting board lol.
why do all apple﻿ fanboys think all apple haters own android? I don't own android. Apple can suck my dick anyway. :)
why is it that re releasing a product﻿ with 2% of it altered considered revolutionary?
I'll﻿ use it as a fucking door wedge.
the new ipad﻿ had over heating problerms wtf
Apple announcer: "high resolution, retina display, high definition, it overheats, oh I don't say that? Ok."﻿ this is what you call false information.
I want see Apple company's death. I hate their products, I hate they﻿ style and life vision. Die apple, die bitch faster.
this ipad has malfunctions﻿ like overheating. Apple gave false information which s not cool.
The "Retina" screen makes video somehow look better than the resolution of the source video?! NO! good for ebooks and viewing photos "Thicker and heavier than iPad 1 or 2! High heat quad-core GPU to support gimmicky screen! 100% markup on manufacturing and parts cost on the base model (like all apple products)! STILL lacking sd card support so you can overpay for 32GB and 64GB models! It is a great﻿ mobile point of sale platform for iTunes! buy it because we told you to! Apple: be a sheep"
The bad﻿ of apple is that all the things need to Pay android is better than apple android vs Apple
brother i need help i am on ipad(1g) 5.0.1 untethered jailbreak,﻿ but the apps keeps crashing, takes a lot of time to open apps also and touch isn't that great, so i was thinking of downgrading to i don't know 4.3.1 or 4.3.3 or 4.3.5, also can you tell me which untethered jailbreak is available of these and which is the best of these.
I'd also like to add that this constant bickering between techno geeks is tiring and 'trollish'. Weigh up what you want from a tablet or laptop and choose what works for you. I love my games, so I'd never buy a tablet or mac﻿ for an aesthetic like that. I digitally paint, write, blog, tweet, photograph, video and watch movies on the tablet. As well as music. But I play my games on the PC, obviously. I have to add, not thati t matters that constantly saying 'ipad iphone i' is like saying ME ME ME.
It should have flash on its﻿ camera...
I tried to use an ipad for my business and the temperamental nature of the device is a hindrance. Intutive, responsive and fast is totaly bogus. You would be better using a device that allows for optimum efficiency and workloads.(Like an Ultra book with office.) Wait for Ivy Bridge and win 8 if you're﻿ a professional. A beautiful screen none the less. What happened to Justin Long? A bad purchase now I have a $1000nzd ebook reader, but all the kids think I'm cool. I dispise the youth.
I﻿ don't like it :p I'll get a virus on it
It looks greats but id﻿ like a new ipod touch
i bought an ipad 3﻿ a week ago, (32gb wifi /4g) not too heavy and it desent heat up, but it is very easily scratched on the back, and the screen will shatter into a million pieces if dropped from below waist height !!! its rather slippery and not to comfortable to hold at times, if anything, its too thin, needs a leatther case, then it should be ok battery lasts about 7 hrs, not bad.. both the cameras are shit, screen is pretty good overall i like it much more that i thought i would
"You're all losers! You think you're cool cause you buy a 500$ phone with a picture of a fruit on it. Well guess what, they cost eight bucks to make, and I pee on every one! I've made a fortune off﻿ you chumps, and I've invested it all in microsoft. So now my boyfriend Bill Gates and I kiss each other on a pile of YOUR MONEY!" Gotta love The Simpsons :D
I have to be honest i hate Apple, but i have to warn u. Don't buy iPad 3 save the money & buy iPad 2 (if u really want Apple), because the resolution is maybe better but u cant watch movies in higher quality anyway & you can't tell the difference﻿ on a small screen like this.
my istone is﻿ better than this
iPhone is a copy of the﻿ LG Prada, iPad is a copy of the Amazon Kindle.
this ipad sucks , again is a overrated product , it gets hot really hot , slow charge﻿ , problems with wi-fi and 4g , and the main problem it runs iOS lol im selling my ipad 2 which is better than this but anyway im tired of apple
Apple products stink they only pot in what the consumer wants as for a technical PC it can be used for many things that a Mac can't do if you own a Mac or iPad try to download something .... Most of the time it won't work because it is for a PC. It's a good idea﻿ but they need to fix that and put it into business proportions not only what users want but everything they can offer. Apple can be better.
ipad my ass﻿ ! they literally sell you this fuckin thing so you could buy apps from them too .
So... I have a powerful pc, a music studio and a good phone. Why would I buy this? Its just a huge thing﻿ to carry around.
Still dont see this like﻿ anything else as a toy
Looks like another pos﻿ to me
New I pad﻿ has a problem with the Batery takes very loooooooooooong time to get to 75%
The new iPad had to﻿ have a more powerful charger
Apple Class Action Lawsuit for ipad every﻿ one should do it..
all that talking about the resolution for the new ipad and this videos resolution is only 480p? i mean cmon.. seriously?﻿
I hope﻿ they can make Ipad that can play powerpoint...
I hope that people will enjoy their slave made iPad (with a huge amount of useless pixels - that the human eye can't catch) & I hope "The Apple Boss" will enjoy his 200 mil. dollars a year. The Asian employees have to work for only 62.000 years for earning as much as "The Apple Boss" earns on a single year - I hope they enjoy their life & I hope that people will enjoy their beautifull brand new electronic﻿ brick.
Dammit! my dad﻿ got me the new iPad 64gb wifi only. i need a new Phone! not an ipad!
Cant these people just put on﻿ a flash player to it >_<
motorola xoom is better,,,,I applaud apple tho,,they have taken advantage of people being sheep,,,,people there is very﻿ little difference between iPad 2 & iPad 3
The Motorola Device is﻿ also Cool but as the Apple Devices too it`s very Expensive.
I might have to be broke for a while but.. I wouldn't mind going into a little debt for this. (college student, only work on weekends, not including friday) I just bought the﻿ iPhone 4s a few weeks ago (1st apple product) and it's pretty amazing. I've always hated apple, because I know their history and plus I'm a big linux user. (hate windows even more than apple) so yeah..in a nut shell lol
Wonderful. More iPad purchases means more jobs and taxes in China. Nice going! I can't wait for the Chinese cyber warfare tactics and strategy, as well missiles funded by the idiots of the United States come back and kill us!﻿ We deserve it! I hope everybody who survives the Chinese invasion of the United States knows how to speak Chinese.
Microsoft surface is﻿ better
As much as I dont like Apple there is no other tablet that even﻿ comes close to this one.
Surface just tell the world that iPad suck﻿
On monday, microsoft﻿ announced the Microsoft Surface, you should check it out... :)
ever heard of microsoft surface?﻿
Microsoft Surface﻿
the battery of the ipad 3 its so bad in the box say that the battery of the ipad 3 is 10 hours but really﻿ are 3 hours of battery
fuck﻿ iPad,better save you money for a mac! the 2011 mac!!
apple is for fags and tech noobs. ﻿
Microsoft IS better﻿ than apple :) Really.
Same iPad as before, just a steeper price and a 3 added onto the end of the name. Apple sure has lost it's way since Stevo﻿ left the building
microsoft surface.﻿
microsoft has always been better than apple..............................my farts are better than﻿ apple
stevo﻿ was retarded
the ipad is retarded, you would be better off with a piece﻿ of wood.
Microsoft just released Windows Surface which has its own keyboard and can serve as a cover, and its Windows 8. So will you shut﻿ up!
thanks but im﻿ taking it to sell it to buy windows :D
STOP TO BUY, You have to think﻿ before put 500$ in a heap of steel, you buy the apple designed behind....
Lol just get a ASUS Transformer﻿ Pad Infinity . So much lighter thinner faster and better
many tabs better﻿ than ipad!!
Honestly - I play more on my iPad 2 while my New (New iPad) so you won`t regret getting the iPad 2.﻿
Lol the iSight camera is﻿ a shit. No HD!
Now if only some of﻿ us could afford it...
Tablets are a complete waste of money. They don't have any functionality. If you want something light and portable, but is still very functional, look into net-books. I﻿ would recommend a Hannspree netbook. It is very powerful for one.
I see your point, but if you are going to get a tablet why in the world an iPad? There are a bunch of android ones that are way cheaper and function just as well﻿ as the iPad or maybe even better than it.
As a normal person i say the iPad is overrated,i have it and use it only﻿ to.. 1.Rage viewer app 2.Google chrome app 3.Urban Crime game(app) Thats how a normal person (not geek) can use this wish i got a ultrabook instead.
The main function of an Ipad is letting people know﻿ you can afford one
just dont scrape the iPad when you﻿ flip the egg, lol !
Bought it, sold it on ebay after a﻿ month. Yes really
The price is too damn high﻿
Why the hell dose Apple think EVERYTHING they do is revolutionary? Yeah Add a Higher rez camera, 4G LTE, and Quad﻿ core processor. NO ONE has EVER done that before!
Nexus 7 199$ Ipad 3 600$ Iphone 4s 200$ lmao Xperia Ion 100$ Galaxy S3﻿ 200$ Retarded Apple Fanboys..... I bet if Apple Released iPenis you'd suck it. Or buy iWater.
I wish i would have waited for the nexus.everything on the ipad has to be paid for.getting stuff on and off is a nightmare and no﻿ bluetooth suport so i cant transfer photos and music is just not good enough.
Samsung Galaxy 10.1 !!﻿ :D
Google has better﻿ maps.
If it only cost $400 you will get 5x the sales which will cover the cost for the ridiculous GP on it. If you were dedicated to creating and improving the product you need as many people as possible to be using your product. Everybody needs a computer, not many people need one of﻿ these aswell so make it cheap, make it ridiculous for people not to have one.
i watch it﻿ on my new acer aspire laptop.﻿ i love acer!!
useless.﻿
That thing is a giant﻿ piece of shit get a HTC jetstream that's a real tablet
Acer w700 is﻿ better!!
Guys do not buy the ipad 3. Apple makes it seem better than it﻿ actually is. I regret buying mine..... its absolutely a piece of crap. I will be buying a Galaxy note 10.1 or maybe an asus transformer. Goodbye Apple
Apple please stop copying LG and come up with your own ideas. First you copy the﻿ iphone design from LG Prada.... then you copy the ipad from LG's 2001 ipad..... then you sue your competitors like a lil bitch =.= Grow the F*** up.
even i got the ipad 3 for my birthday.but now i am so sad.. i﻿ got my ipad a bit late..and by the next 2 months ipad 4 was released which is much better than the ipad 3 :(
Throw your The New iPad away! Get﻿ the NEW iPad with the A6X :)
"Apple and Microsoft would never use their app store rules for censorship or to block competitors, only to block buggy or dangerous software" It's really sad how people throw away their liberty. Actually, they don't just throw away their liberty, they happily spend $300+ to have it stripped from them. I don't understand it. Happily allowing a few companies to gain an absolute monopoly on all software and hardware. Nevermind... Just tap and swipe. I didn't mean to﻿ make you think.
FUTURE OF EMAIL WRITING: Could samsung tablet provide option to write emails on yahoo,﻿ gmail, facebook freehand like writing notes on notepad? Why these options have not yet available on iPad, tablets irrespective of touch availability? On iPad we can write email with freehand but it go as an JPEG/TIFF format when we forward to some one.

iPhone. Except 3 times﻿ bigger.
I'm watching this on my iPad 4th gen (ipad﻿ with retina display) :D
Was trying this out last Saturday in stores. It﻿ wasn't bad but it was pretty heavy! :O
gosh i hate that blue analogue clock! i cringe every time i see it!!﻿
Because the apple ipad 2 is the best tablet out there.﻿ Sure, it has it's flaws, but at least it is built great, and it has great features. So, buzz off :P
asus eee﻿ pad is better
neo is better﻿
But you can't do anything with it... You can only connect it to a PC... That's why you should ALWAYS get a laptop instead of a tablet if you find the﻿ two at similar prices... A laptop has a FULL OS on it and you can do ANYTHING you want with it.. You CAN'T download pictures from your camera on your tablet, you can't transfer music to an MP3 Player, you can't edit movies, you can't do anything productive on a tablet...
IN THE LECTRONICS WORLS 90% OF WHAT YOU SPEND IS WHAT YOU GET, IM REALLY SUPRISED OUT OF ACER TO RELEASE A TAB....IVE NEVER BEEN A FAN...ID LIKE TO MESS WITH ONE OF THESE THOUGH....I DONT LIKE TO﻿ HEAR ITS HEAVY AND BULKY SO WE WILL SEE...
Could you do an in-depth review on the video decoding capabilities of this Tegra 2 tablet please ? I've heard it can only play mp4 files encoded with h264 baseline profile , which could be problematic , since most of the video files i'm hoping to see and store (not stream !) on this device would be h264 high profile 720p/1080p in mkv container and softsubs.Not sure whether this is a software issue with honeycomb or a limitation of the Tegra 2 SOC.﻿
900 BGN makes it the cheapest good tablet on the Bulgarian﻿ market, but it's too much compromise to live with. Samsung 10.1v pretty much obliterates everything but the ipad 2.
Plastic screen? Scratched?...pass﻿
I find it a bit to heavy and gumby still﻿ good though. =D
transformer cuz of﻿ the keyboard.
stupid bulky piece of plasticky shit. Who﻿ the hell still uses SD card slot on a frequent basis? They should have leave that out to cut some weight. and HUBS? lol they don't admit its nothing more than a few folders.
I heard theres some connection issues? Also will a hard drive connect and play movies straight from the usb port?﻿ Please answere.

galaxy tab 2﻿ way better:-)
I just bought this tablet and is much better I﻿ thought, especially for it's price, however if you can afford another tablet like a Xoom, you should definately go for it.
Can anyone tell me why it does not play movies? Contact me at willkc8088@yahoo.com if you have any info. I notice that I﻿ can find nothing on the net that even mentions watching movies. I mean you can watch a complete movie on a freackn cell phone but not this device. Help!
Bought one three days ago. Very happy with it for the money.﻿ So far I've had no bad experiences except a few aps that don't work well on a pad instead of a cell phone. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend one!
acer A500﻿ poor !!
eee pad ﻿
I must say, after having this tablet for 3 weeks it was an excellent buy. It may be﻿ slightly hefty but it really shows its value in its performance; very high quality build. Just need a screen protector to cut down on fingerprint marks.
actually now the best 3.1 Honeycomb tablet is the "Samsung Galaxy﻿ Tab 10.1"
soon as you said SCRATCH PLASTIC SCREEN, you helped﻿ me go to the asus.
dont agree﻿ !!! Eee Pad Transformer is the best !!!
yes its a Great tablet, i have it. and i havent heard of a defective 1 yet. and if ure afraid of getting another tablet then i would﻿ go with an ipad 2 becuz they usually r never defective but cost a little extra:) hope tht helped
Galaxy Tab 10.1 is the﻿ current best Android tablet
go with asus transformer ( get it at amazon just in case you might want to﻿ return it ) transformer has a gorilla glass,ips screen very durable.
the acer iconia has very lacklustre, dead, dull colors. i bought a galaxy tab and my brother just bought an iconia a500﻿ yesterday. the iconia couldnt play an hd movie without a little lag while the galaxy tab played it smoothly. We are quite the gadget freaks. so we do know how to set﻿ things right. im quite disappointed with the iconia. hopefully a future update will contain a digital vibrance feature to add life and vividness to the colour.
I have this, and I'd recommend buying the A501. I hate not having 3G. I've heard about cellphone tethering, but I'm too cheap to﻿ buy a new phone. I bought this used for $75 after all...
And how the hell do﻿ people afford a $450 tablet? I need a new job, or I need to work more overtime.
Ipad is﻿ better!
my aunt haves one i don't like it the OS very buggy i gave it﻿ a try, its only one week old that's why i don't like android i'm so buying an iPad 2! i have used the iPad 2 and i think is way better for my life style :)
I prefer Asus﻿ Transformer
after looking at tablets for a week﻿ straight I settled for this one and I don't regret it at all. its a bit heavy but that makes it feel more durable than other tablets..
Cumbersome!﻿
Asus is a much better and more﻿ trusted company. They make amazing PC parts. Asus has better hardware, and is a all out better tablet. I hope this helps :)
seems to be a lot of issues and wasted time with failed updates . i had to download a 350 MB file 4 times, and after the﻿ 3rd time when it did unpack, and failed, i did a system restore, download again and got "invalid update" error message. and there are loads of others mentioning this since july with previous updates. i have search google all day for a fix etc, this has wasted a day of mine (8 hours) .
I have the Acer Iconia Tab A100 and it has the exact﻿ same specifications as the A500. And about the screen, i think Acer uses low quality one because there are some flex on it each time i put some pressure and the display will get distorted. But its very sensitive. Sorry for my bad english lololol.
i got this﻿ tablet today and im returning it, really its a really nicely made tablet but its too heavy and thick, if you dont mind about that its just fine, but im getting the samsung galaxy tab 8.9
I got one for chirstmas early and I'm taking it back it's terrible not worth a penny in my case save up and get a MacBook...﻿
good﻿ but sucks. asus eee pad tranformer prime is the best nowaday tablet
what about the battery life? i am really interested in buying one but i﻿ read it is just 3260 mAh. :( Your help will be really appreciated! Thank you very much!:)
so I cannot use my sim card with this tablet?? too bad :S why does it have the slot there? it's like "hey look at what you might be able to use but you won't﻿ "
im using this tablet and my main gripe is that sound recording is bad. i was recording a video of my husband playing the piano and it sounded very choppy. the video was grainy and the photos can be grainy but for most part i consider﻿ the camera an extra to the tablet. im not sure if i want to purchase it out right or look at other comparable models.
also on﻿ the sides its just completely flaaaaaatt. its just not comfortable to hoooold..... dude...grow a pair
Galaxy tab has a slightly﻿ better screen, but this one is usually a few hundred less (so a much better value) plus a full size usb!
motorla xoom has a slightly better screen and is slightly smaller (more portable), but the iconia tab has a full sized usb port and is usually much cheaper so I'd recommend the iconia tab!﻿
the picture and color quality if this is garbage compared to the galaxy tab, so far the﻿ most kickass is the galaxy note. ultra crisp and clear. Go to a store and compared them side by side. You guys might regret buying this when you see the galaxy note.No BS!
My screen is blocked ! Plz help ! it's a virus ! ? o.O After instaling modern combat 3 the screen of the descktop were bleck and the tablet restart﻿ ____the screen Blocked﻿ !
besides being kind of heavy I haven't﻿ found anything to compete with this. with the 5mp camera with led flash, micro SD slot and all the other features I really like this tab. I would like something a little smaller and lighter but I can't find anything as good as this.
Is anyone else having problems with the built in microphone or the camera? ﻿
This tablet has no gorilla glas. It is plastic he stated and easily gets scratches. He has got two on his as he stated in the video. Then it has a proprietary charger instead of USB Charging. This is a fail in sight of compatibility :( If one﻿ USB power didn't work, you still could use a cable with 1 microUSB to 2 usb ports, like external self powering DVD Burners have it too. Still fixed power standard over USB and so more compatibility in ways of how you want to charge it :/
And as long tablets "all" have such big delays (input to actual movement), they "all" fail in giving a "true touch feeling" :/ There will be tablets with direct input feeling, but not yet. This market is very young, people who want a﻿ true deal should wait for the later generations :)
If it was capable i would say more ram and prob about 100GB of memory but i can get a for that is compact with pretty much all they accesories for cheap and if i want computer﻿ i have my net book which is slightly bigger, more capabilities and it cheaper.
I Have The Same One, Hate The Fact It Freezes﻿ Alot.
This tablet﻿ is a little outdated now (almost 2 years I think) Only has tega 2. Still a decent tablet, but I'd currently wait for the 32 gb nexus 7
I have one of these and i like it a lot! The only thing that i don't like in articular is the weight specially when you're lying down in bed and watching Netflix: it tends to be heavy and will tire both of your hands while holding it when you're watching.Other than the weight,It's great tablet and it will always Upgrades and it promps you the user. It's Android OS so it's pretty much complete. Maybe i'll get the Google Nexus 7 after this but for now, it's still great as a﻿ tablet!
Another great review, but I'm still a little worried that we're not seeing an explosion of developers at least announcing Android tablet apps. I hate to say it, but it looks like the iPad might be unchallenged if Google doesn't start getting devs on board.﻿
699 eu﻿ for 32 gb. too much
I bought one end of Oct. 2011. After 5﻿ days of standard use, it started resetting at random times. Technical support in Israel gave an unprofessional handling. I regret this purchase, though it has a cool user interface. Don't buy if you live in Israel.
This Tablet is somewhat inconvenient ... just﻿ buy a Asus Prime!
its very heavy... but looking good, and solid.. but i﻿ a little bid confius either this gadget want to be a tablet or notebook?
I agree. Android is really unstable and not reliable.. Me owning both an iOS and Android tablets, phones, etc. I've found that since the﻿ Ice Cream Sandwich update (4.0.3) They have moved it to the most stable thing I've ever seen experienced with Android so far. Android will really be kicking with their 5.0 Jelly-Bean (Released rumors Q3 2012) and 6.0 Key-Lime Pie (Released rumors Q2 2013)
erm headphone jack at the back .....hello not all people use headphones when there at home ...... and plus the tablet would be in your hand so the headphones wont﻿ be coming over the front off the screen because it has rotation on the screen ....... common sence does help.
Nice Review as alway But of all the tablets i've seen so far the only one that really impressed me﻿ is the Blackberry Playbook! it probably wont be the most popular tab among consumers compared to the ipad but it is the most impressive.
Stupid zombies work well﻿ on my Xoom
: I agree, I love android but all of these tablets﻿ (including xoom) seems to be running a public beta version of what honeycomb could be.
Good honest review -﻿ thanks. I have heard from someone that they had Flashback 7.1 ROM on theirs and after a week their pad is no good and won't even start. You heard anything like this ?
hi, mate i just installed honeycomb ya, but flash player n i cant download anything from android market﻿
Great review, have bought this tablet myself on ebay a couple of months ago. Still have the frogo os on﻿ it. Is it very differcult to change the os system. I'm a bit of a novice when coming to the tech of a product. Any advice would be great.
Yes it does. Since this video﻿ more affordable tablets have hit the market. Google Novo 7.
You talk like Tegra 2 is never going to lag. Be a little more realistic. It's a﻿ computer. All computers lag. I don't care if you put an i7 quad core at 4.0Ghz, it's eventually going to lag. Software updates and usage of the device will cause that. Try all this again after you've had the tablet for 4-5 months and have it filled with stuff. My G2 never lagged when it was 1 week old, but after 6 months, it has a little bit harder time with the same apps.
I saw lag 5:43 right b4﻿ the first attack.
I still think it's a great device and want it. the only problem for me is the steep price. Also why do these things not have more space? I remember iPods with over 100 gigs but we can get a tablet with high space? Thats kinda a turn off for me. I still﻿ would like to buy this even with the price but I fear there is a better, cheaper, tab around the corner running Android 3.0
im kinda waiting for the archos 70 to get 3.0 for that exact reason, 250 gigs on that﻿ bitch
Who cares about tablet games... Its ok for now but soon you can play fear 3 or better on xooms or﻿ any java/flash tablets by the end of the year. Onlive.com Gaikai.com <--- has WoW running on ipad
ipad﻿ ftw
You﻿ wanna hear a joke Xoom. Get yourself a real Android tablet :)
i'm saving up for one of these and working on m turk a lil﻿ bit to earn some extra cash to purchase this. between this and the ps vita this year will be expensive i suppose
Thanks a lot for the video, would it be possible to test the tablet with a pen with side buttons? (I guess the tablet comes with a buttonless pen, unlike﻿ promotional photos).
Thank you brother - I was hoping for a stand with USB ports, but the device seem to﻿ rock anyway.
i have one, but, going to return it due to a hot pixel in the﻿ middle of the screen.. i think im just going to get my money back
I have a stuck pixel as well in roughly the middle area﻿ of the screen as well but Ican only see it when the screen is completely black around the area.
Asus monitors are trash. I would have hoped they put a good﻿ one in this, but I see problems. Asus what is wrong with you.
I guess there is no news yet on extending the battery life? This is the one area that is still a bit iffy for me. I have 4.5 hours of continuous classes some days and I would really like to use this to take notes. Though anything is better than the 25 minutes I﻿ get with my current laptop.
How would you compare the battery life of the ASUS and the HP slate 500? I'm guess the HP will have a more durable battery because of﻿ the less power-hungry processor?
I think 64﻿ Gigs is not enough!
I think 1280x800 for a 12.1'' screen (~120 PPI) is just not enough, combined with that pretty fat pen, for efficient handwriting. I usually write much﻿ smaller than the size I people use with this kind of device, which is probably because it just doesn't recognize smaller letters. I might be wrong. Show me someone writing something readable with that pen not bigger than the default Windows UI font size and I'll get one of these and stop using pen and paper.
..yea the resolution was no better than most cell phones & the battery life lasted 3 hours tops.I took it back & got﻿ the Motorola Xoom.Best tablet out right now hands down.
They shouldn't let go their signature kickstand they have in original IDEOS S7,﻿ the one before Slim.
pldt﻿ telpad
Great review and a great tablet, only thing i﻿ think its missing is an AMOLED screen, but thats just me!
Oh look the﻿ Asus iPad 2
I meant in terms of looks. Seeing as Apple are suing everyone at﻿ the moment it's a dangerous move to design something almost identical to the iPad.
Thanks Joanna.... The whole point of this video was to say that the IPAD 2 is better. You are a fanboy﻿ just like me. Go Apple..... Thanks..... I love IPAD 2.
I think it was actually a mistake releasing this with honeycomb due to the fact that all the reviews will be lukewarm because of the software.. Everyone would have forgotten about it / reviewed it already﻿ by the time it gets updated!!
Omg﻿ i gonna sell my car to get this
Is the constellation supposed to be the planet or the drug? It's not often that you see someone fail to answer their own question. Anyway, the point being made is that Honeycomb has yet to be able to compete with the﻿ iPad in terms of tablet-specific apps; as tablets are, at this point, media consumption devices, apps matter. I love my Transformer, but I'm not in denial about its faults. It's one thing to like a device, but another thing entirely to worship it.
I feel like you guys say this ALL THE FUCKING TIME, just wait until Honeycomb comes and apple is in shithole, just wait until windows﻿ 8, until Froyo, until windows phone 7, until HTC HD, until Samsung Omnia, until HTC Diamond and hundred other killers, meanwhile apple is beating this one with 9 MONTHS old tablet, making more money then rest of the field combined and being most recognized brand on the planet. Just get over it, your "killers" will never kill apple.
regarding the apps for tablets and the marketing of their products apple﻿ is still leading...just look how many times asus postponed the release date of the prime...thats a shame...they gonna lose the biggest chance, the christmas sales...but in total i think we'll see a big progress next year...just look how many brands are already selling android based tablets...i'm looking forward and i'm just waiting for the release in germany...
I can't find any use of it, as I got a notebook and a﻿ smartphone, but﻿ damn, I just want it!
Sony reigns﻿ supreme
I'm sorry but Android 3.2 still SUCKS. Flash performance is still too slow which can lead to lousy browser performance in Flash heavy sites like ESPN. The OS itself is still no where nearly as smooth and responsive as the iPad 2 with iOS, is this specially true if you bog it down with too many widgets or run a live wallpaper. I hope they can nail all of these﻿ issues with 4.0 but I doubt it unless Google make it a priority to improve useability.
So sad my Transformer was stolen. Loved it, but still won't buy a new tablet until﻿ it can do more. Windows 8 tablets are looking pretty damn good so far, but we will see.
Although I hate anything with an Apple logo on the back I will say iOS is﻿ definitely slicker.
I really don't understand, lol. So because we don't have to pay for Android, that validates its obvious disadvantage with regards to tablet-specific apps when compared to iOS? Again, the point I was making was that, for all﻿ the people complaining about "OMG SHE R MENTIONING IPADZ", the comparison is pretty valid. Yes, the Prime has fifteen cores and and a Jesus Display, but iOS still has more tablet-specific apps- and with tablets being consumption devices, apps matter.
if only they﻿ can make android have more apps. hoping the software will be better after the update.
Apple staying with a great old﻿ os is really bad isn't it? This must really be hurting their sales. The reason Apple hasn't changed iOS much is because it doesn't need to be changed! People are happy with it, and, though I wish it weren't so, Apple devices are the most popular things out there right now. Hopefully ICS will be as fantastic as your are expecting!
As﻿ I was saying. Why get a tablet no matter how fast it is if there's no apps to use on it. The apps is what makes the Tablets and the smart phones fun to use. And if anyone tells you otherwise they are lying to themselves. That's why apple products will sell regardless of their restriction because they have 10 times more and better apps than the android market. And b4 you start to criticize me. Just know I have both tablets.
I love this tablet but i hate android, android apps are not good enought to make use of this beast, they are still laggy,poor UI and give unexpected errors like installation and poor sensitivty. iOS even though with less config products can make﻿ better games and app, make them run far better with less errors and more stable. What will you do with a quad core﻿ if you done have the right apps for it, so still, iPad 2> Any other tablet.
you're﻿ not alone. I thought the previous model had a better looking backing too but maybe this model will look better in person.
Doesnt even look﻿ that nice
who buys this﻿ crap!!?? android apps are ridiculous in tablets!
Boot loader is﻿ locked and encrypted with 128bit encryption.﻿ WON'T BUY. #lostsale
Tried one out, it's sucks just like any other android tablet,﻿ lousy, laggy UX and crappy oversized phone apps..
She's shown in the video﻿ holding and using the device, moron. And this is how the Verge rolls: a short, sweet review that doesn't drag on. If you're a fanboy of this shitty tablet, go watch some of the 100 crappy unboxing videos.
The galaxy tab 7 plus is a much better tab than the both of theses reason why it﻿ cost more. Guy below
I'm not sure who does the﻿ camera work now but I'm not liking it.
Such an ugly device.﻿
Have you seen the commercials for this with Jane Lynch? It's so stupid!﻿
It's not you﻿ but something about this tablet just seems dull to me. The review great as always but just nothing here to be excited about
HOW COME this is so﻿ smooooth. U FAIL AMAZON
i agree, how dare they try to tell﻿ you what to use YOUR data for! I'm rooting for the kindle. I don't know who made B&N the new "apple" with all the limitations.
If you pay enough attention, you will notice the﻿ nook screen is flickering. I've checked lots of nook color and hoping the nook tablet will solve the problem but it seems B&N doesn't recognize it... sigh...
It flickers,﻿ right?
Meh, I'm still﻿ happy with my TouchPad ^_^
Amazing intro and theme song! I'd buy it if it were a bit more expensive and thicker. Not﻿ bad, though. I like that it comes with ladies' hands.
You could play Amazon Prime content in the﻿ browser, but the quality and speed are so much better in Amazon's own player. It doesn't look like it can play videos on Veetle.com
Wow this only has 1 gig ﻿ for non B & N storage, I was going to purchase this, will not now.
Lisa, another Nook tablet user reports Veetle.com worked for him but much better with the opera mobile browser﻿ on his nook tablet
I disagree for two reasons. A) For $50 more than the Fire, the consumer shouldn't have to pay upward of $20 extra to purchase the﻿ same amount of free-for-all storage as is included for $200 in the Fire. B) They're marketing this thing as having 8GB more storage than the Fire, which is simply not a fair argument considering one could argue it has less (for the consumer not looking to buy much B&N content and wanting more of the core functionality.
The nook, you can run the amazon store on, with about 30﻿ seconds of work, its very easy, which makes the nook a no brainer, although making the shortcuts to apps from the amazon store is not as easy, you just have to type the name in and it will come up
Is it my imagination or is the display a little washed out﻿ compared to the Kindle? I would love to see them side by side.
then again, if BN offered downloadable video/music similar to what apple did with itunes, that'd be a different story. at least then, you would be﻿ able to justify the whole fifteen gigabytes mentioned in many of the nook tablet's commercials. i just feel the way BN is advertising the huge storage space is just an easy way to make sales before reading the fine print and footnotes on the website. and yes, you can stick in a micro SD but before that, they are already mislead.
What I wonder about is whether the battery is replaceable either by the user or B&N. That was a major failure of the Nook Color. Don't get me wrong I love my NC but the battery issue is pretty disconcerting for quite a lot of people because if your battery fails and you're out of warranty you're left with a brick and must replace the unit out of pocket. Other than that﻿ this was a great review. Fantastic presentation and very informative. I give it two thumbs up, five stars and a hearty bravo!
hi.i'm from the philippines and i'm planning to get one of these...however, i've been asking around and i've heard that you can't donwload apps and books from barnes and noble from the philippines... so﻿ basically, they say that i'll have to depend on sideloaded content. is this true?
For watching movies, Kindle﻿ Fire. For everything else, Nook Tablet.
so what would the other content be for? i dont quite understand. and﻿ for recommendation im not much of a reader but what a cheap tablet like the kindle fire or nook tablet
iPad is﻿ better
so you cannot download apps from﻿ the android market correct?
Why can't it be﻿ in android 3.0?
Seems like nook is better then the fire but. Fire is marketed more so I wouldn't be surprised if the﻿ fire sells more
im very conflicted i cant decide whether to get this of the kindle fire the kindle is a hundred dallers less but i am﻿ in love with nooks i had the original i can't decide
@ChesireCatGaming both of these "tablets" are a joke. you want a real tablet get an ipad. you want a android tablet get the eee pad.﻿
@XxxKaoru because these types of tablets are made﻿ for grandmothers and people who don't know s@@t
lol, but its cheap﻿ and fast although doesn't have camera but I think its still worth it. Maybe it can upgraded to ice cream sandwich next year
i think﻿ the kindle is better..
definitely the﻿ htc flyer!!!!!!!!
What makes a lot of people prefer the Kindle fire over the nook tablet is the fact that the Kindle has way more apps﻿ than the nook. But what people don't know is that you can EASILY sideload the Amazon app store onto your nook tablet. So in my opinion I would go with the nook tablet.
The original Nook was rootable and so could do all these wonderful things with Linux to begin with. They made it so you could not﻿ fully make functional your original Nook Color to do what you wanted it to do. This is a non-product.
Stop selling up shit we cannot mess﻿ with. Unlock these fancy COMPUTERS so we can do what we want with them. Don't shower on us a little at a time devices that are locked up with features we KNOW are there. STOP IT you greedy motherfuckers.
i would get this thing but.... its..... ugly..... i like the look of the fire better but i would still﻿ buy this one over the kindle fire.
In speed and memory, the nook beats kindle fire. But there is one huge problem. Although it says that there are 16 gb of storage, 1 gb is accesible to user. 13 gb is used for B&N stuff (upgrades, book. etc). Although, the nook color has a micro sd card so u can add more memory. If﻿ u can live with only 1 gb of apps, then yea.
Kindle fire- nook tablet. Nook﻿ is boud ugly af'
i watched this video before i got mine i was excited, and now that i have it, i hate it. its a nice device but i'll be returning mine back to BN since you only get 1 gb of personal space and their market is way over priced. i think i'll look into the kindle﻿ fire, maybe the htc flyer
can someone tell﻿ me why my nook always gets disconnected from my wi-fi !?!?!?!?!
I got this for Christmas ... I love it. My only complaint ... thought the volume would be louder. ﻿ I don't even detect audio until about the 5th bar.
I got this for Christmas and I'm on it right now! My only regret is that the﻿ store doesn't have a good selection of free stuff
it said 1 gig for yourself...﻿ is that enough for a 12 yrs old kid who downloads apps and music rapidly.
Barnes﻿ and Noble was originally made so homeless people could have public restrooms.
Don't buy the nook tablet!!,Save your money and buy the nook color instead and pay for the hulu and or netflix﻿ separately. The nook tablet costs more because you are paying for the 1 week trial subscription of hulu+ and netflix. Another case of big business making the little guy bend over so he can slid a stiffy inside.
I rather read﻿ a book. I like holding them.
Yep, it's faster, sd card slot for more space (up to 32 GB sd﻿ card) but in apps it doesn't have so much but their working on getting more(some of the apps are kind've overpriced). Nice speakers. Browser's not that fast but they have puffin & dolphin browser HD. they removed root and sideload but you can still do it just need a sd card.
You spelled Wacom correctly. :) No, the Nook Tablet doesn't support digitizers like Wacom. You can use capacitive styli, but they are a lot less precise and not design for serious﻿ drawing.
They have DRM, and you can't play﻿ them on the Nook Tablet unfortunately.
Got the nook yesterday. Bought 2, 1 for me and my daughter and I'm disappointed already. The books aren't free and neither are the apps they advertise. You see the display in the store of pacman, a﻿ drawing program, movies and angry birds but when you get it you'll find out you have to pay for all of it, even tho you have it on your pc or cell phone for free.
honestly out of﻿ the amazon kindle fire and the barnes and noble nook tablet, the nook color beats them both by far and yes i tried them both by far
so i can't get new books or sync my nook to my B&N acct unless I'm somewhere with access to﻿ Wifi
How come the cool page turning animation on Android phones where it looks like actually﻿ turning a page was carried over for the magazines on the Tablet but the official built-in Reader app on the Tablet only has a generic sliding page turn?
It﻿ sucks
Yes, but not only is it not brand new, but it doesn't suit some people's needs. I need something small, cheap, and compact, so I can easily use it at school. Plus, I don't need anything fancy, also, the iPad doesn't have an SD card slot, nor does﻿ it have flash.
No, a lot worse. Get the﻿ Kindle Fire.
I returned mine because it the left side where the handle is was separating and I noticed that the front frame was getting worse. I got a newer one and it's the same thing. I can actually see a crack and see the inside of the device from the handle side. Anyone else?﻿
The review was right at the time,﻿ but now the Nook Tablet does not have 15 Gigs of storage reserved for B&N content anymore.
Really?? U only basically﻿ have 1 frickin gigabyte why can't u have 16!!! Then it would defiantly be so much better than the kindle!!!!
NExus 7 has major screen issues and dead spot scrolling. Better to get an ipad mini in September﻿ or Galaxy
someone pls answer this i cant space on my nook i just got﻿ it i'm writing an essay but cant space
want waste of time & big﻿ disappointment u can't Down load FREE apps or books um less u have s credit card
Lol same with iPhones and Android﻿ phones jackass..
I used to﻿ love Barnes and Noble until they robbed me of $250. whyiwillneverdealwithbnagain.b­logspot.com . I'm sorry to spread it this way, but I'm seriously angry and also want to let people know what kind of﻿ stuff happens behind the scenes.
Everyone, take Note, this looks like a﻿ good device. He he he... see what I did there?
This is the best thing on Earth planet. Well, I want some improvements. Six thousands M A h, five hundreds﻿ gigabytes SSD harddrive, twelve Mpx photocamera with CONTINUOUSLY AUTOFIXZOOM ON TEXT PAGE FIT HIGH SPEED SCAN.
Nice...I'm waiting for the Galaxy SIII﻿ though...
@bigbone38 hell yeah!! I might get﻿ this phone as well when I get a chance. Right now the price is too high at over $700.
to big. nuff said﻿
Samsung is the king o exaggeration﻿ -__- wtf is that
Not gonna lie the "phone" looks good and all but that's exactly it, I want a phone not a tv.. 4.3 inches is good﻿ enough for me
razr maxx has a much smaller display and 3000+﻿ mah battery...take some notes Samsung!
It looks good, I like big screens but 5.3 is too big for a﻿ phone o.O but to each their own, some love it some don't.. thats life
the battery still only offer less than four hour browsering , amoled really suck too much power displaying bright﻿ background.
If only they didn't ruin the asthetics when they bring it over. LEAVE THE THREE BUTTONS, SAMSUNG. IT'S SO MUCH NICER﻿ LOOKING!
I don't like the mess that﻿ is Android.
too small﻿ must be bigger!
DAMM﻿ DAT SHIT BIG
That phone﻿ is big af. I can't rock with this one.
I﻿ would buy it only if it was a lil smaller :P
already in India for so long. I had a chance to experience it n this thing looks ridiculous when u hold it against ur ear for a call.﻿
No﻿ ICS on launch? FAIL!
Looks painfull to use..........﻿
Best-spec'ed phone on the market, as far as﻿ I am concerned. The only turn-off is the gigantic size. 4.7" is as large as my hands will reasonably go.
TOOO BIG!﻿ :O
$800 for a phone.﻿ ffss ppl get somethin better for tht money. idk a pet or something?
I love this phone, however I am not﻿ sure how portable this would be in everyday life.
Whereas iPhone 4 is too little, this seems too big (especially if you already own a tablet). I think Samsung Galaxy S2 is the perfect medium lol but I'd be interested to﻿ actually play with this
DUUUUDE. I'll laugh at those who has﻿ this phone.
the battery actually looks pretty small for a﻿ phone that huge. lots of space there for a bigger battery
Too bad my carrier (Sprint) won't be﻿ getting it..I would dump my Galaxy Epic for this...
thats﻿ fucken huge.
that shit is huge.﻿
Perfect fit for Andre The Giant﻿ maybe
that﻿ phone is fucking huge i think not i hate large devices
those are called stylus﻿ dipshit they go back years before ds was even conceived in the minds of Nintendo retards
My favorite thing about﻿ this phone is al of the that's what she said jokes during reviews and such
hahahahaha is 5.3 inches too﻿ big!!!!!!
This phone﻿ would be awesome with Draw Something :D
fuck this junk﻿ smartphone... I used an iphone 4 and switched to this galaxy note and now i hate this , fuck android ... fuck samsung .... 3.5" iphone is way better than any phone .. note - junk UI ....fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck offff
hmm﻿ pen sucks its not clickin-.- 04:50 and 04:53 and 05:16
:D:D yeS yeasterday yeasterday really and﻿ i got it really so﻿ cute but so big but i love it and the cOlour is black.
I cant fit that into my﻿ pocket!
i love my﻿ iphone
I like the Iphone, but I want the scren size. I will have to deal with android for it, but I like the idea of having a big﻿ screen.
I preffer the IPad lol that phone is﻿ Sooooo BIG it dont even fix in my pocket lol
motorola...﻿ chucks it aside. x)
I recomment note ll if you like big screen. This one is obsolete now.﻿ The S III is good also and perfect if you dont want to wait
I like how you say﻿ that but the Notes made of plastic! compared to Real Aluminum finished with Diamond!
its too small for me. need bigger!!!﻿
2 should﻿ be better @leehyukjae
Note 2﻿ is better
the nook tablet is going to be better than this. that has more memory (expandable via microsd card, up to 32gb) and has a 1.0 ghz dual core processor. its also not too expensive, only $250 at launch. definitely more﻿ worth getting than this
I read on other articles that the speed doesn't seem like a 1GHz processor. Something about lag when﻿ turning pages or browsing the web.
i thought this was a great deal at first, but, the way its locked down with no expansion.. its a whiole lot of meh. kobo vox or the new nook is going to kill this. even if its﻿ rooted, theres no expansion at all.
Nook﻿ much better
I would love this device, but I need my gmail tho﻿ =(
Asus Eee Pad Transformer Hits $250 on Black Friday at Best Buy and﻿ got GPS front camera Sd card is only $50 dollar more
Our Nook Tablet review will be up tomorrow (Weds), so come﻿ back to see it! It's definitely worth considering vs. the Fire.
The "Search" thing is like... a direct copy of﻿ WebOS Just Type... -.-
Nook Tablet is going to blow this out﻿ of the water.
It bothers me that﻿ so many people consider to buy this for their 10 year olds. It might cause a shift in the market and the next generation of Kindles might be catered to kids only. I think if I would go with a small reader, I would use the Nook Tablet. But I prefer 10" tablets for magazines.
The android market apps are a﻿ lot of junk--sheer quantity says nothing to the quality of the reviewed applications and syndicated applications that amazon attracts to its store.
love your reviews, but i will be sticking﻿ to my asus transformer :-)
Thanks Lisa...Great job as always....and about the﻿ tablet i don't like "cooked" android versions.
hmm﻿ nah ill get the transformer prime.
i personally like the kindle fire a lot... so i would go with that one... of course the kindle keyboard has less features but doesn't give you eye﻿ starin and finally price... nook color is 250 kindle fire is 200 and kindle keybaord 99/139 so its up to you, i think the kindle fire is best with its good features and its good price.
I'd definitely buy this if it had a﻿ camara
I wish they would've kept it in the e-ink format...as in color e-ink. Going the multi-use tabs route disappointed me.﻿ Reading a full novel on something like this is eye killing.
But video playback isn't that﻿ clear...its choppy sometimes.
Difference between the Fire and the PlayBook is that the PlayBook﻿ is much more powerful.
I wouldn't consider buying it, it has no advantages instead of normal Honeycomb tablet. What, the hell, this interface looks like?! Why Angry Birds aren't in their store﻿ fo free?! This is idiocy...
Damn amazon not having the fire available in the UK. It﻿ looks really really good too :(
@MobileTechReview, whats better in you opinion, nook tablet or fire? I am leaning towards the nook tablet solely based on the 1GB of RAM. My phone has a gig a RAM and even that thing﻿ slows down. Why would amazon only put 512Mb of RAM in the NEW Kindle Fire?
its kinda awkward to think of a tablet that relies so heavily on the cloud, does not have a 3g version. i know they tried to cut price down, but it dosent make sense to make a portable media consumption device that cant hold media and is not﻿ portable when accessing media online
If you are fine getting content from Amazon, the Kindle Fire should be a nice step up. But if you like 3D games, the selection﻿ is much smaller on Android vs. iOS.
The e-Ink is﻿ a lot better for reading books primarily. Your eyes won't get as tired as reading on an LCD display.
Well I'm getting smoothing better like a galaxy tab but ny sis﻿ is 7 now so For Christmas she getting one so I'll screw around on that For awile!!!!
The thing looks under powered. Based on this review I bought an Acer Iconia A500 on Cyber Monday﻿ for a mere $225.
i love my kindle fire, but finding a wifi area is annoying. is there a device you could recommend for me to use﻿ to access it whenever, wherever?
so there is no﻿ youtube app?
Broken space﻿ bar, I'm guessing?
I got this the day it came out and loved it, to everyone else though...don't buy this thing and expect ipad performance. Its a great tablet and the amazon content is amazing but you will see the difference between $200 and $500. I would still advise you get this tablet overall﻿ though
can you view youtube videos in 480p﻿ on the kindle fire? I doubt it could play in 720p without stuttering a bit.
Oh, yeah. There are a lot more features and contents with Prime.﻿ ;) Glad we could help!
slow and choppy, especially for a dual core device I'll stick﻿ with my 1st gen iPad
Noticed during the "Lost" video play back there was a Yahoo advert in the lower right corner.﻿ Is that going to be there all the time? It was kind if intrusive, especially if you're already paying for a script.
it seems like just a way to make you buy a bunch of﻿ crap you can get for free on a laptop ;-)
For me this has broken all the rules of what a kindle is for ﻿ Its good but not for me
What a kindle is for is as obsolete as the book,﻿ itself.
Buy an﻿ netbook
No, unfortunately no cameras﻿
why the hell are they not﻿ available in ireland (or the uk because i tried) until after christmas
I love mine.. but it is﻿ a little small. I wish the screen was 1 or 2 inches larger then it would be perfect.
My uncle just brought a kindle fire as a gaming device for my cousin, would you﻿ prefer the fire, itouch, or the blackberry play book? I find the itouch and the play book to have more features, what would the fire offer?
Dont buy kindle fire. If you buy a kindle fire from other country than the USA you can´t buy any more apps or games. Yes you read it correctly, you cant buy any apps or games. I tried to buy one game and the amazon-kindle fiasco dont allow to buy it because my method of payment had a non USA billing address. How come they did allow me to pay for the kindle? IS A FRAUD. so people from﻿ the world dont﻿ buy kindles cause you cant buy anything else no apps for you (no more soup for you Elaine).
when i go to settings and hit﻿ wifi on the wifi network selection window doesnt come up HELP!!!
good morning. No you may not buy any games or apps, because you have a method of payment where the address is a non USA address, they will not allow for you to buy APPS or Games. i was able to buy a book but no additional features, so the purpose of the tablet which is to have more﻿ features than just reading books has gone the drain. you may pay in pounds because amazon does not care how you pay for the tablet, but once you buy it you can´t buy anything else.
however also there´s an issue with the purchasing of the apps or games. I have﻿ talk to a friend and he did pay with a method where the billing address was an USA address, and guess what? the store did not let him but any stuff, not a single game, why? who knows? kindle has a big problem in their hands and if they dont stop blocking customers from buying any APPS or games the kindle store will be the loneliest place in EARTH.
@iguana681 unfortunatly no﻿ it has no mic sorry
ill﻿ stick with the iPad
My Kindle Fire won't turn on, I've tried﻿ resetting it & it still won't!!! CS sent me a charger to see if something was wrong with the charger, but it still won't work! I've had it for 1 week & it WAS in perfect condition.
Just want to let everyone know that Maxthon browser is available on the kindle fire via amazon appstore. This browser will make your browsing experience much more enjoyable because as we all know the silk browser sucks, I love my kindle fire but its the truth. For those that are tired off the sluggish silk go to the appstore and get it. I'm not linked to them in﻿ anyway just a happy customer!
They don't have that currently unfortunately. Amazon has a large collection of books including titles for young adults, but they﻿ don't have the nifty interactive books for kids found on the Nook.
hehe im watching this on my kindpe fire. i love my﻿ Fire but the only problem i have with it is the keyboard. just typing this comment took a while cause i was constantly unintentionally typing wrong letters
AMAZON FUCKING SUCKS!!!! BEST TABS- HTC EVO VIEW AND IT 4G AND GALAXY﻿ TAB, ACER, TOSHIBA, MOTOROLA KINDLE FUCKING SUCKS DICK!!!!!!¡
From a technical aspect the Nook is "better" due to things like more RAM (1GB﻿ compared to the Fire's 512MB) but personally I feel everything sort of synergizes and flows together better on the Fire than on the Nook.
the new iPad﻿ owns this lol
u r very much right coz i hav an ipad and it nt bad i must say but its jus nt worth the buks.i hd to dig very deep into my pocket.About $1100 afta imports etc.its better to buy the upcoming NOKIA's PURE HD VIEW thing wit i guess 41 mp camera nw tats worth﻿ it!!!!
Amazon still have silly issues with there eco. Things still don't show up on your/in "device" section even though its the right format.﻿ You have to use a 3rd party app or look at it through the gallery. Same with the Kindle app for Android on phones. I have to send it to myself kindle email for it to show up even though it's already in the cloud. These are never fixed issues since the launch of the Kindle Fire.
@ScMusic15 Yes, the Blackberry Playbook. Originally $500 but on sale for $200, does way more﻿ than this!
The kindle fire is great for apps movies and music and web browsing but if you want to use﻿ your kindle more for reading, the kindle fire may hurt your eyes because of the LCD backlight. So if you wanna get a kindle to read on I suggest the other kindles so they won't hurt your eyes
Kindle fire...LOL.﻿ Shitty (and small) low pixel screen (170ppi) NO microsd slot, no GPS. No﻿ external volume button (WTF﻿ LOL). NO google apps, NO app store, NO home button, NO folders, TERRIBLE touch accuracy, NO bluetooth, low battery life... people who buy this are suckers. You're better off buying one of those no-name-brand Chinese android tablets from Ebay for $50, but then at least you'll get half the features missing from this giant turd.
If you love android, go for the Samsung﻿ Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. It has full a full android experience and access to android market while the playbook and fire don't but it's $50 more. Or you can wait (like I am) to see what tablet Google will come out with in a couple months. Supposedly the Google tablet will have a better screen and processor than the Fire and be around the same price or maybe cheaper.
@x0xSapphireIrisx0x Blackberry Playbook﻿
the internet is﻿ very laggy......,....
plus dont read because i cant seem﻿ to find any good books that arent nine dollars.........
Get a playbook,better built and really a quality piece of kit for a discount price now﻿
Nexus 7. Definitely.﻿
Looks decent but the Nexus 7 seems so much better﻿ to me.
Right now it wouldn't make sense to get this when the Because 7 is out﻿ and the Kindle fires succesor will be out by either the end of summer or early fall!
Nexsus 7﻿
Kindle fire SUCKS, get a﻿ ipad 3! You will hate the laggy kindle. Trust me! apple is superior!
no. it has no outputs for it . trust me dont buy it﻿ its a waste of money
Too bad it doesn't have 4G or 3G. It's﻿ strange that many of these tablets will only have wifi, given that they are devices that rely mostly on internet based apps...
only... 6 gigs... i am not using﻿ cloud so yeah, no movis 4 me
KF was great till the Nexus 7. N7 has camera, mic, Bluetooth, quad processor and more for about﻿ the same price. Think this review was available before the N7, so grace is given! :)
nook fucken sucks﻿ get a kindle.
Transformer Prime!﻿
As a personal preference, I'm not especially enamoured with the tablet form factor.﻿ To me, they are reminiscent of some sort of pet-sized gravestone from a bygone futuristic film that never was.
Prime﻿
I hope your waiting﻿ for the Asus Transformer Infinity.
No, I'm sick of waiting for better tablets all the time, buying iPad 3 as soon as it comes out in﻿ Norway.
Rotation is pretty fucking slow. Either its using a crap gyroscope or honeycomb is still buggy. Sad.﻿
Only 512MB of RAM. All new tablets has 1GB+ Using this will not be comfortable with so﻿ small amount of installed memory :(
I have been waiting for 8 months for the 256gig unit to come to the US. Also they should put a 5 or 8mp camera on the back. They originally said it was going to be in﻿ the US in October 2011, now November, Now December or will it ever get here? The tablet market will get so saturated that you will be able to buy one for $ 99.00 that does everything!
i had one of these, but then i took﻿ an arrow to the knee
The Software they added really makes it a bit of﻿ a mess.
They should have made it with windows xp or﻿ 7.
tooooooooooooooooo﻿ expensive
Am﻿ I the only one who really does not like Android 3.1?
galaxy tab 10.1 ftw!!!﻿
I will never buy a product that is either﻿ a tablet or has to do something with 3D!
I agree. Until the notion of 'tablet' competes fully﻿ with toppling the need for the modern business laptop, it will remain a media consumption device...a toy. Tablets need to service an appropriate OS that will install and run current brands of business & graphic software; not these wannabe apps that are little more than 'one bell and two whistles for 3.99' widgets.
it﻿ looks like the $100 HP Touchpad...not very tempting...good luck Lenovo.
I used Android OS and now the Web OS and I have to say Web OS is so much more stable closer to the IOS. Web OS can handle flash content so much more smoothly than Android OS. I had alot of problems with video hick-ups and mess up﻿ graphics on web pages when I was using the Android OS.
Does this have﻿ the whole android market? I heard any android device with a screen bigger then 7 inches does not get the full market. With my Gtablet I was forced to use Handango.
Bought one 3 days ago on sale at best buy for $350. Returned it yesterday. The screen has lines running lengthwise. The lines are every 1/4 inch in rows, very strange, likely a defective unit but to me shows the poor production quality of lenovo. That aside, the brightness, contrast, and viewing angle is below par﻿ even for a non IPS display. Other poor design was the top edge, its 2 pieces slapped together with sharp edges and one piece is plastic other metal, poorly designed and made product.
I noticed that when you selected to play a video,the bar on the bottom doesn't disappear like in asus transformer,right? Is there a setting to make it disappear to watch vids full-screen because I find the bar annoying while watching﻿ videos...
@MobileTechReview I noticed that when you selected to play a video,the bar on the bottom doesn't disappear like in asus﻿ transformer,right? Is there a setting to make it disappear to watch vids full-screen because I find the bar annoying﻿ while watching videos...
Check out the ThinkPad tablet which has﻿ dual digitizer that's better for taking notes.
I bought It yesterday and today it is kinda damage now the only think I can do with it is look at the hour unlock it and that's it I think I will get It back to the store﻿ and replace it with a galaxy tab
..No books in PDF format?? Really?﻿ I have well over 1,000 of them.
Would be able to remove all the Lenovo pre-installed﻿ apps. I love this tablet... but I hate the lenovo apps.
do nota buy this i bougt one for christmas and by the end of january it stoped working so icall lenovo and they bring﻿ a technicall service tp my home and after review they told me that thy dont have the components to fix it and that they wont fix it so i get a 500 usd brick please dont buy this tablet get a galaxy tab or anythin but this
Why don't these manufacturers provide a place to download these apps IF you want them, rather than pre-loading﻿ them? It's crazy.
no native usb port?!?!﻿ WTF. Its like apple product, you must buy a adaptator to use usb. What kind of PC,laptop or tablet doesnt have a usb port??!?!
piece of crap...ipad is god compared to this fucking piece﻿ of ass fling shit
wtf resistive?﻿
hard FAIL﻿
realy, dumass..﻿ dont compare everything to the ipad...but this viewpad is kinda bad.. but i rly hate it when ppl try to compare everything to the ipad
$200 for this crap!? More like $80﻿
Pay me $200 and I'll﻿ consider using this piece of crap.
Resistive?!?!?!? REALLY?!?!?!﻿
Resistive?!﻿ $200?! $20, and I'll consider it.
a plank of wood is more useful﻿
the best thing in this vid is the GameBoy!﻿ ^^
Stop Reviewing Bad Stuff ﻿
Don't thumb down because the product sucks, the review﻿ is good.
I don't even think there is﻿ a market for this brick... maybe in sped or preschool classrooms
this look like the wort tablet, if your gona get a﻿ tablet with $200 you should get an Asus eee Pad Transformer Prime
In other words, they hand these out to prisoners on suicide watch.﻿
Stopped watching when I﻿ heard resistive
Good﻿ lawd. That screen is TERRIBLE.
Viewsonic never will eave a chance﻿ to compete against any tabket mabey the ipod touch
OMG﻿ 480 by 800 for a 7 inch screen that is even lower than a 3.5 inch iPhone 4/4S screen!!!
what's﻿ the point reviewing this crap?
Why would anyone put a resistive touchscreen on a tablet?﻿
I think the review made the product sound 10x better then it actually is.. If anyone else did a review of this﻿ Product.. Who am I kidding, no one has even heard of this albino brick
Just buy the﻿ Kindle Fire.
wow, although this tablet sucks, I haven't seen any android tablet that has as smooth transition﻿ animation as this one..when opening app and going through home screen..lol
Viewsonic ? I suggest you shut down all operation now . Your device is﻿ not gonna sell are you are gonna get bankrupt sooner or later . Shut down now so you dont lose more money
The only﻿ thing that is nice about this tab is you have vanilla android 2.3 . Works fine . Not sure this will be updated to stock ics which is even better than stock 2.3
The iPad was the first tablet. THE END. Apple made it perfect and not even after almost 2 years is anyone capable of making a tablet even close to the﻿ iPad. BTW all tablets are just some lame copies of the iPad.
Root your kindle fire and GO Launcher EX app for﻿ a much better gingerbread 7" tablet at the same price.
i have this one,i think it`s good, i have watched youtube and netflix plus hd movies seems fine to me,maybe some poeple will love it some will hate it.i﻿ have htc wildfire android phone i like it more than an iphone.i paid 200pound for the tablet which i think is over priced.
its﻿ not a tablet its a white book with a screen
Build quality is always an issue with Acer. I have one of their﻿ laptops and its worked well fo me for almost 4 years. But from day one liiiiitle things have not been as tight as you would like. I'm serious to see what the Asus tablet is like.
xooooooommmm!!!!﻿
Really, it comes down to android vs iOS. If you want more functionality﻿ and customization, this tablet is better. If you want a great battery life and a really easy to use tablet, the ipad is the way you want to go. I personally prefer android, because you can customize your pages with widgets and I prefer a more computer like experience.
you are right, I've owned the acer Ferrari branded notebook for a﻿ while now and it works pretty well. I have the Iconia and I don't see any cracks in the aluminum like what Lisa said in her review. The viewing angles is pretty good, the sound is damn good for a tablet, I only wish it had the Movie Studio like the Motorola Xoom. Oh, and it's much smoother than the Xoom.
nice but better wait 5-6 months for tegra 3 tablets, a lot of the software issues in and around honeycomb should also be resolved by then﻿
@f4ww4z iPad 2!﻿
Acer Iconia A500 cannot do﻿ 1080P playback that's a shame.....
This unit is "NOT" up to its spec's! Should be﻿ taken to court for false advertising! Does not play 1080p movies as they claim! Nor does it last 10 hours with movies as they claim! Lot of misleading info from these Manufacturing companies!
I don't see tablets ever taking over laptop computers or even netbooks. I bought one on last monday, and i had to take it back. It's freaking heavy and i'm gonna buy the Asus eee pad transformer,﻿ which is a lot better.
im between this and the xoom. i really like the body design of the xoom and im happy with moto products. i have a droid right now and i LOVE it. (rooted running cm7). the only things keeping me form the xoom is. will the a500 be rooted and supported by cm? (locked bootloader?) . and. THIS HAS USB HOST that is a huge selling point for me. and the fact that it cant handle the video playback is.. well. upsetting. but that should be fixed with and update. i bet﻿ its a driver issue or something
Thanks for showing me that it's still time to wait until they get it right. My Nook Color runs video better than that. A case that's coming apart﻿ is enough reason to be suspicious of the care that goes into the manufacture of these, and the waking glitch, Bah, not ready for more crap.
Asus transformer﻿ has them all beat hands down with price and features!
the Xoom is﻿ awesome. played 1080p with no problem. these cheap knockoffs just don't cut it.
This item costs more than the ipad 2﻿ 16 gb wifi, so go fuck your mom you little 13 year old bitch.
watching big bang love song! BigBang just the bests!! (fan moment) this tab seems to be pretty smooth isn't it? but i﻿ think tha asus did a better job on eee pad transformer, don't you think?
you can﻿ use it when you are taking a dung instead of using a phone where you can easily drop it into the toilet.
A cool tablet, but Acer has a small laptop that is about as small as a tablet, so what is the﻿ advantage of a tablet over a small laptop?? The camera is one thing, but the little laptops are more affordable. Could you compare the Iconia to Acers little laptop?? How do you keep the tablet screen from getting a bunch of finger smears??
Video playback =﻿ fail.
thats the brightest it can go? on my﻿ xperia x10 android phone thats what it looks like without any brightness. Or is that because of the angle?
@MrCompaq92 if you are﻿ able to afford i would go with the new samsung tab 10.1 due to its bill quality etc. if not then the xoom its a much more reliable tablet than the iconia tab
i would wait for android tablets little more. probably a year more as the operating system is yet not mature﻿ and features/functions are still evolving for the tablets. i would still use my ipad 2 for a year, the user experience with droid tab is still naive. it like samsung 7 tab that was realeased a year back. every one just rushed to purchase one and then most of them were hugely disappointed and reports shows that many were return with few months . This is just my opinion. i might be wrong
that sheet scared me D: ﻿
the video playback is what's holding me back..the 1080 playback shown here really sucks! btw﻿ if you're thinking about getting this, staples has a printable coupon for $100 off tablets that is being accepted at office depot. google it.
Very slow﻿ for videos....
@onlyrunonsupreme i suggest you go to bestbuy and try both out. although i used both for just a few mins. i loved the acer A500. the ipad has the big advantage of having so many apps, but honeycomb is much smoother than it looks in this vid. this tablet also﻿ feels just as solid and well built as the ipad. android will expand the app market, obviously. it is a hard choice. but also compare the prices. this tablet has a great price tag.
advantages of an ipad 1) it is slimmer 2) it has better graphics3) it has cool apps 4) its more famous BUT ITS DISADVANTAGE IS ITS EXPENSIVE DUE TO WHICH IT MAKES US MAKE﻿ A 2 YEAR LONG DECISION WETHER WE SHOULD GET IT OR NOT
No it doesnt support sim cards :( same as galaxy tab, asus transformers﻿ etc :(
I JUST got this one for $280 bucks+ free shipping+no applicable taxes. I﻿ was aiming for the asus transformer(for the screen resolution mainly and IPS), but I got the chance to get this one instead for the price tag only.. Is it a good buy??
YEAH RIGHT people﻿ don't have bread to eat and i'm gonna give $750 for a fucking overpriced phone. I can buy a new computer for that $
ok I just got this Tablet. Im ok﻿ with this tablet, But also I own a Apple Ipad 2nd gen. Nothing to compare with Apple. but I like this one also, AND I saw that is compatible with Microsoft Work, which Apple doesn't, but I just have 1 quest. Can I print out documents?? I tried but i couldn't, can this be performed???
a500 is better its cheaper , lighter , thinner and has USB port . Only advantage of XOOM is that it gets O.S updates earlier then any other tablet﻿ .
That video playback was horrible, thanks for showing﻿ that the Iconia blew it.
galaxy tab has 3G or later 4G, but in other way Galaxy tab has a﻿ 3.2 mpx camera if I'm not wrong... I would pick tab 10.1
I like this tablet when i got it for the﻿ first day, but then I was just playing a game on it, it was running well then the screen started screwing up, and then the screen turned white, I tried reseting it and turnining it off/on, didn't work, so im guessing i will have to return it.
If you like to sketch with your finger,﻿ capacitive styli tend to not work well with serious drawing and skip. The Lenovo ThinkPad Android tablet and the HTC Jetstream that have active digitizers would be better for drawing, especially with Sketchbook Pro. Check out our reviews of both.
Wow, video seems to be﻿ very bad...
i hate this thing, i hate one of my own, im not sure if its just mine that they screwed up on or what, but it has﻿ to many problems
I was caught in that situation. I think the Xoom is better all around but I got the Acer Iconia from Best Buy for $229 + $10 gift card on their cyber monday sale. They aren't that much different and I couldn't find justification for paying﻿ $150 more for the Xoom.
i﻿ think ill stick to my accer netbook
Did you have any problems with the video playback with browsing? I just got mine and the video is blurry, idk y. I know its 720p not﻿ 1080p but this isnt 720p quality Im getting.
I bought this Acer A500 for $250 from Best Buy on Cyber Monday and after using it for a while, it's no contest. My iPad 2 beat this tablet hands down. Android 3.2 is still not responsive not enough and the flash capability is dragging this browser down big time. Websites﻿ take longer to load and the lag while scrolling through the webpage is super annoying. Flash heavy sites like ESPN can bring this tablet to a crawl.
Your reviews are always the best!!! You basically sold me my phone and now probably my future tablet. The 1080p video play bothered me. Since you have looked at more tablets then me, could you inform me straight out, which one of the 10" android tablets have you been most﻿ impressed with?
The Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Asus Eee Pad Transformer are two of﻿ my top picks for WiFi only 10" Honeycomb tablets. Good luck!
Why are you comparing thickness to an iPad 2, when your iPad 2 has a CASE on it? Talk about a biased review.﻿ The iPad2 is actually a lot thinner.
This does have gps, i have it, great tablet only thing that they can say is that's it's a little heavy, unless your a pusy it won't affect u, the iPad is another way for apple to﻿ sell you something like a oversized iPod, look st the iPhone 4"s" wdf apple!!!!
I have heard rumors about Netflix not being able to play on this tablet, but that review﻿ was done when the tablet was running 3.0. What is the latest version of Honeycomb that is available for this tablet, and with the new updates can Netflix be used? *please respond*
I'd say that *no* touchscreen is good for heavy writing (I'm a writer as well). Their are cases out there for this, though, that have keyboards built in. I don't have the link, but it was only﻿ ~$40.
I'm very impressed with your review. I liked how you put it together. I'm wondering if you are going to review the Asus Tf300. I'm torn between the two.﻿ Both have issues.
Just bought a used one today for 250$... Seems like a pretty﻿ good product. But weird thing is that the tab cannot connect to my d-link router... Will have to buy a better more recent one...
It says 1GB of ram and duel core CPU. Yet when I play Modern Combat 3 on it, it pales in comparison to my iPhone 4S which supposedly has a duel core CPU and only 512MB of ram. The graphics are way worse and the frame rate is borderline unplayable. There is no way it's up to 30 frames per second. It's not my tablet, it's my uncles, so i﻿ don't have any other games to compare it to other than loading time on Zenonia 4 being significantly slower on the Acer. Just shows that specs aren't everythng.
Getting the galaxy tab 10.1 but﻿ this is second chose bur just not as good
Ordering mine tomorrow. I don't see what the fuss is about the A200. Seems like a cheaper tablet with the same specs, dimmer screen, and a "better" UI. I think the A500 looks better﻿ as well. But better or worse, I prefer the brighter screen. Hope I am making the right choice.
shit,﻿ didint have a slot for simcard
Is it worth $220 (refurbished). It's getting a little out of date but I want it for﻿ taking notes for highschool.
This tablet is faster, larger, and has more features than a kindle fire. I bought one refurbished off amazon and it was even cheaper than a kindle fire. Great buy for a decent tablet. We returned our vizio vtab to get this one. The camera is decent, 2mp front, 5mp back. Doesn't compare to my logitech﻿ pro 9000 desktop webcam, but is all right for casual use. Microphone works nicely. This tablet also has support in the rooting community.
Thanks for your answer. This was the kind of review I was hoping to see. I have been thinking about getting a tablet for a while but as we all know the ipad is too overpriced for a guy like me who has bills and who is currently a college student. So i needed to go for something that works﻿ but for a lesser price and this seemed to do it. I have seen so many $60-100 tablets out there all with terrible reviews and well this review you posted is enough for me to say I would buy one. Thanks :)
How﻿ does the webcam on this one compare with the A700? I know the screen resolution is lower on this one but its also cheaper.
the﻿ ipads are always going to be better then their competetors, there is nothing any android fanboy can say to change that its just a fact
dont buy an acer please!!!! you will !! be sorry i bought 2 trying 2 be cheap and they both took a shit the first month took it back to best buy ,traded it out and that one didnt work after a month ,plus the battery died soon after charging ,the video mic was﻿ so low you have to scream to hear the audio ,and called acer ,abunch of indians at c-service tryed to get me to pay them just to see whats wrong with it ,,,bought a ipad been happy since !
The a200 iconia is way﻿ better
