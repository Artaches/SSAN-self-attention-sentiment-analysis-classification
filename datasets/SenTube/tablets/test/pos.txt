The Motorola XYbord has some great features... I partially like the 'Holographic Cat Projector' function seen at 18:22. :) Thanks for the in-depth review(s) Lisa, I find your vids incredibly helpful when making purchase﻿ decisions.
Droids do so can do so much more than iPads. I don't even know why people waste hundreds of dollars﻿ on tech that can only do half of what a Droid can do. My droid phone can mirror but you need to buy an Apple TV for your iPhone to be able mirror. Apple is a waste now.
On the purchase, I ordered my tablet from the Motorola website. It was easy enough; customer service on some follow up items needs a lot to be desired. The free protective portfolio case that came with my purchase is flimsy at best. The﻿ tablet works as mentioned above, I also purchased the USB hot cord to attach flash drives that hold movies; pictures; etc The cost is still one attribute that might keep you away from purchasing the tablet ..but as far as performance, it is outstanding.
That thing loos﻿ faster than my prime...on honeycomb while its on ICS .
I like this. but please reviews samsung 7 series﻿ slate pc - its the best tablet now
I want this so badly but it's soo thick and thats﻿ a huge issue for me
i would﻿ definitely say Thinkpad. Thinkpad has excellent customer service and the company outruns any other company in terms of customer satisfaction.
I looked at this tablet before deciding on getting an Ipad, I was looking at some drawing software (Sketchbook) and pen and liked the fact that the Lenovo thinkpad comes with one (although optional), furthermore I had bought a used Thinkpad laptop when it was still IBM for 300 bucks and loved it. Did my research and because none of the 6 different major electronic stores﻿ in town had it physically in the store I decided to go for the IPad. Great review by the way, I don't regret the IPad...
A tablet with a 3g connection, a usb port﻿ and that runs on android. This is it. I wish I'd had heard of this before. I was waiting for either apple or samsung to release a tab with a usb port, and I was dreading having to go to microsoft. But here we go :) Found my nexty.
I﻿ thought the same thing, until i seen some demo videos of people using the browser. Its not as smooth as the ipad, and is a bit laggy. That being said, the Tab is a good device. I think RIM's PlayBook beats em both.
I love my iPad but i really think this will be better. Its android it﻿ has already won.
FYI... I have the IPAD now but only the 1st 2weeks I was so excited but I had the chance to see & use the GALAXY TAB & its a very solid Tablet (﻿ advance hardware than ipad, then the quality is SO GREAT, you can root & do everything in it soon by help of XDA & lots of android guys) 3 things ONLY IPAD has on it ( Much bigger screen but not as portable as the tab, it has more applications then IT HAS APPLE LOGO) GALAXY TAB has so many better feature & much portable & much solid built. GALAXY RULE!
Sure, it's nice. But seriously, look at the design. It looks﻿ like a phone
what could you do with a fuckin i pad im sure this thing can do all the thing a ipad can do and more proabably﻿ cheaper too and more hackable unlike you stupid mac products suck my dick motha fuckaz plus screw all of these pad stuff just get a phone and a normal goddamn laptop
@ForsTrucks555 even if its 999 times better it still sucks compared to having a﻿ phone and a laptop
I am a huge apple fan. i have the iphone 4,macbook air and the ipod touch. But i do not own the ipad because it a giant piece of s#!t that only a dick who wants to show it off would use. my﻿ iphone has all the capabilities of the ipad, and a billion times smaller. now this galaxy is small enough to take places and to use as a nice tool on the go if you dont have a iphone or droid. i say this deserves a 8/10 compaird to ipad 3/10. galaxy <3
dear friends.. im a running a mobile business and﻿ to be honest apple is apple BUT Samsung has done a great Job Samsung Galaxy Tab really rocks it has beaten ipads market globally. now im a user of Galaxy Tab just imagine what u want and u will get it. cool graphics, with real time touch feeling. even carrying it much easier. 10/10 galaxy \o/
the iPad was supposed to replace the computers, but it does not support flash player. i know that the ios is more user friendly than android, but you can﻿ do way more with android. please tell me how the ios is better than android
@NWGuts : It's definitely very stupid to speak like that since the samsung's tablet offers many advantages that we don't have with the apple's one, "flash" for sites, cam with flash, more and better functions, better movie's quality, visiophone and so.. So some people should definitely stop to post comments if they can't﻿ afford to post interesting and valuable comments, that's it!!
Yea this Galaxy Tab is selling like hot cakes. It's selling almost as well as the iPad and I haven't seen the commercials half as much as I've seen iPad commercials. They﻿ sold 1.5 million in a couple of months. It's on track to sell about ten million units this year. And the Galaxy does FLASH. A lot of web sites require Flash and if you have an iPad, you're screwed much of the time. Steve Jobs is stupid not to let the iPad do Flash.
only iPAD and iPHONE are﻿ overrated.
Overrated - yes, bad products? - no The iPad is extremely overrated and I expected more from apple in their tablet-entry, but it is still a solid, fun and very good product. Apple will not﻿ win the tablet war, this is the ultimate opportunity for the competitors... The iPhone is another matter as it is simply the best phone on the market when it comes to all-round performance and offering here. The price is way to high though...

Samsung Galaxy S 1900 is better then the Iphone. ﻿
Correction Samsung galaxy s 1900﻿ is better than the Iphone
A matter of taste, i prefer the﻿ iphone 4 because of the UI (touch response included) and the design, camera and screen. But the galaxy S is still a bloody good phone!
This is a﻿ very informative﻿ video. Mobile marketing is truly coming of age. As smartphones and apps﻿ become better, the possibilities are endless. I currently us Apple devices and am anticipating the Android adddtion of Honeycomb. Who knows wher this will take us.
Im on mine rite niw :P guys they are﻿ so worth it :D we have an iPad but this is so much better :)
i﻿ <333 samsung
It works fine for﻿ me, I just love how small it is, sadly without Honeycomb :(
@applegjs but apple does not support adobe flash and the adobe flash﻿ is really important for my business
2.3? Single Core? (well 1.5Ghz is alright) Pen﻿ is great! I like 7"
Love this flyer and I will﻿ definitely pick up Flyer 2
Except or the 500$ price, it﻿ looks like a great device. Will be amazing for 300$ (w/o the stylet).
I have﻿ this device. Its awesome
its 300 now. i﻿ would reccomend it.
This is the﻿ best tablet ever.
thts wut i was wondering! like im not sure! and for﻿ fun wod this be a good tablet? like games?
Really HTC Flyer P510e gives a trendy look and it is very smooth and handy set to use , It has various features like All new HTC Sense 3.0 with Android 2.3, Built-In Memory of 32GB added with Micro SD extension , 5.0 MP Main Camera and 1.3 MP front Camera and with all these advance features its﻿ price is also reasonable(RS.22,790),It is a good smratphone and become very popular now. shopbychoice(dot)com
I am crazy for HTC flyer............. Graet phone with great﻿ features shopbychoice(dot)com
Awesome (asides from battery life)﻿
Not﻿ for 99% of applications. If you use a heavy duty complicated brush in photoshop you might find some lag. Applications that are well written do not lag at all.
Yes, you could buy it instead of a PC, although personally I would prefer it to have a docking station for that purpose. Really battery use time is about 3 - 3.5 hours (they claim up to 4.5 which is possible, but not realistic) and boot up time for a clean PC is quick enough﻿ to be not worth worrying about since you should only need to do it once every few weeks (use standby or hibernate).
12" is great, but makes it a bit heavier and power hungry than it could be. Yes it does come with Active Digitiser Pen and keyboard. Sorry, but can't do Photoshop or gaming video﻿ as I don't do either.
I'm﻿ a freshman college student for the up coming fall, and I am looking for a tablet pc such as this one so I can easily take notes, write papers, and do research on the internet, along with everyday stuff. I love this machine but I have a budget and it is a little out of it... I love the way it takes notes as you show and that its durable. Do you know of anything similar to this but might be in my price range, I'm looking at $200-$850.
I agree with the guy from the video. GREAT TABLET!!! Just got it a couple of days ago and I wasn't sure it was going to be worth it. It really is﻿ an awesome tablet :D
After spending an hour grilling the sales kid, and using it myself,..i'm definately recommending this one...it's awesome,..and tho it's 'only 1.3 MGZ, it's really faster than﻿ that, and faster than most any tablet i've tried out there. Finally, a tablet with tru windows,...and u also get microsoft office with it!...yippee!!
This is a beautiful looking device. Windows 7/8 tablet+photoshop/illustrator=awesomeness. I would definitely consider a﻿ device like this to replace my laptop. If they can squeeze in a 3d gpu, and I'm sure they will soon, then this would be an even more amazing product.
I am so glad I found this product review on here. I hope they give you some reward because I went out and bought one last night The slate fits my need for lecture presentations perfectly. I went with a usb to vga out and it﻿ works as intended. Thank you for this very helpful review!
I own this tablet and it is amazing!﻿ Very fast, pretty light and great at multi tasking. Be aware of the battery life and the sd card reader can tend to break.
It has a very wide cooling vent area on the back at﻿ the top. Cools pretty well from my experience, but you should probably check tablet PC forums for the word from regular users.
Brilliant! I want﻿ one!
Oh, there you are again! Are you trying to convince me or you that windows is dead? Oh yes, that's﻿ the iOs with the paradigm shifting keyboard and revolutionary touch input! Yawn. As a tablet PC reseller I can tell you that the Windows Tablet PC has never been hotter than now, many thanks to the iPad. But that of course is not an Apple sanctioned NLP marketing slogan, so you probably wouldn't believe me! Haha.
Might i just add, all you "apple fans" dont actually realise is that almost all apple products are just copies from others. They copy﻿ every other design and function and just change it around and re name it to try their best to make it "original" and "theirs". dont get me wrong i love apple products, but if it wasnt for windows and other companies, apple wouldnt be around.
I have it, I use it and I love﻿ it! Let the iDiots say what they want, but for someone who wants to do some serious work this IS the answer.
How true it is that without Microsoft, Apple wouldn't even be around today!﻿ Furthermore, Apple WAS NOT the inventor of the icon & mouse graphical user interface that is in existence now; in fact it was Xerox that developed that technology!!! Don't get me wrong -i do understand that Apple does make truly amazing looking products. However, I am a devout PC user and know that if it can be done with Apple, then it can be done with a PC also -THEY ARE BOTH COMPUTERS!!!
Using mine right now! :) Personally I use it to sketch roughs for work in PS CS4 so I kinda feel like the side market for this tablet, the artist. It even runs zBrush very well but it's no desktop or Cintiq just a pretty powerful slate computer. Just want to point out you really need to turn down the win 7 features and power save modes and screen brightness if you want to last past the 3 hr mark﻿ on the battery.
Yes, it is a PC. It has USB﻿ ports and you can plug anything into it that you would plug into a PC and it will work...
I just got one of these﻿ after watching this video and it is a great system. The handwriting is great. A full laptop in a tablet with the Wacom is vary cool. I let an art teacher try drawing and she went to town drawing with the included art program.
Artrage is great isn't it... It has inspired me to﻿ learn to draw better. There's a lot of stuff on youtube that has helped me. Drawing on this tablet feels really good.
I bought it, installed windows 8 developers preview with USB and went the installation completely in touch, everything is supported except bluetooth (install driver seperately). I notice in windows8, there is improvement in the 3d acceleration. The virtual keyboard is the best i've ever typed﻿ on. It's so responsive and has a nice muffle tapping sound. I can type very fast because of the new layout.
The Samsung Series 7 Slate is an 11" tablet with the﻿ Wacom pen. If you're after something smaller, that would be where i'd go...
This tablet would do fine. Many lecturers are already using Windows 7 tablets to replace whiteboards and overhead projectors. Of course if you wait﻿ for the next model, there will be another one knocking on the door!
Depends a lot on you and what you want a tablet to do... Samsung S7S is smaller and lighter with better battery life. It also has a "Sandy Bridge" Intel Core i5 which is newer than the Asus. On the other hand the Asus has a bigger screen and much better colour reproduction. A number of my customers have also perceived it﻿ to be quicker than the Samsung although technically it shouldn't be. Tell me more about what's important to you and I can advise you better,
Both will do fine, but I would lean towards the Samsung for better battery life and smaller size. Be sure﻿ to get the Samsung Stand Case also.
This tablet PC is the computer's industry's version of the series "Firefly". It's brilliant, superior to the competition, but poorly marketed. I just hope it doesn't meet the same end one day, and Apple/Android﻿ zombies don't take over the world.
Great! 10 hours of not doing much plus 5 hours to charge. I guess it all depends on how you value your time. The new Fujitsu Q702 can go 10 hours as﻿ can many oter newer Windows tablets running real productivity software, not poor excuses.
i don't even understand why compare them.﻿ apple has macbooks with macOS to compare with windows. It's so sad how you people have to compare the obvious superior operating system windows, with iOS, what started off as a mobile phone OS, to now a tablet, in order to belittle it. how sad.
and to wrap it up. my ipad fits all my needs. email, word processing, checking school things, and even file management since i'm no noob. yes of course windows is﻿ SO much more versatile, but it does a little more than i need it to do for school, so i thought 10 hours of doing exactly what i need, beats 3-4 hours of endless possibilities that i won't bother getting to. ipads aren't bad at all when youre tech-literate.
not sure what you mean by flat and what's the downside to charging it overnight, plus i've never wasted even half its battery during a whole day's use. Anyway, I know windows is better, that's a little too obvious to point out. But that's what i got﻿ laptops for.
I love this device but dude, it actually does say $ 9,000﻿ for this device on Amazon lol
Too bad the batteries of the future that﻿ would allow such a great windows tablet to run at least 10 hours aren't here yet, ipad and all those android tablets would bite the dust immediately!
one thing i can give apple is that they know how to run there business. ya there should have been a quad core instead of an over clocked 2 core but u have to think, not all of apples apps are optimized to run on 2 cores so another 2 cores wont change much. the ipad pretty much runs on nothing but apps and with out flash those 2 cores are enough for now. i can live with a shitty back camera but they should have given us an HD﻿ front facing camera. thats what im angry about and siri.
Nice thing. Too bad its﻿ so expensive..
its aewsome thumbs up if﻿ you wanna have it too :)
even﻿ though i like android more, im not one of those fanboys. so i really have to admit: a great tablet. im not talking about the software but the hardware. the reworked A5 processor looks promising (even though i dont believe this gibberish "4 times better graphic power then tegra 3" lol) Software.. not a big fan of ios, but those multimedia features like crop/cut photos, videos and music looks cool. :D
i know you can﻿ not afford one...apple is much better the android
I﻿ love how they used vimeo instead of YouTube xD
If it actually performs like shown in this demo, I would be very impressed with Apple. The iPad 2 was not much﻿ of an improvement over the first iPad in terms of hardware specs, but this new iPad seems to break Apple's lazy habit of wrapping the same thing in different shades of grey. Looking forward to the benchmark stats.
So they add the Retina Display, a better camera and a new﻿ chip. Somehow, that's "revolutionary" to Apple... The only reason to buy an iPad is the software support for us Mac users. Otherwise, other tablets are stronger faster and cheaper.
Wow this absolutely creams﻿ any windows 8 tablet
Take﻿ my money Apple!!
I asus prime has a﻿ 8megapixel camera with a flash which take awesome pictures. The camera on the asus is just as good as the over hyped apple newipad camera.
I think sometimes looking at the coments here.. people forget the sheer weight of the innovation staring them in the face. Thank you Apple. The competition isnt even close because the rate of innovation is breathtaking. Iphone, Ipod, Ipad, Itunes, thinnest device, mulitouch, Siri, app store, podcasts, cloud services. Find my device, location based services, ﻿ Ibooks, & still people think Apple is Crap? wake up people this is now the worlds biggest company for a reason. Thank you so much Apple
I love apple!! I had the ipod﻿ touch 2 now i have iphone 4 my mom has the iphone 3 my dad has the blue nano and the itouch 4 i just ordered this ipad 2 days ago i cant wait to get it and if u r thinking of getting an apple product get it!!
yeah all thats cool in all but i love my ipad 2...now awnser me one thing can it play flash? prob not so whats﻿ better about it more high def cool what else its faster so... my ipad 2 already loads instantly and they display is amazing. if it can play flash ill consider it but if not then who cares its just something they hype up again and say its revolutionizing everything when its just a glorified ipad 1 or 2
@Weegee9005 No, they don't. Apple only﻿ released 3 mobile devices a year. Dipshit Android releases at least a dozen phones and several tablet annually.
Urmmm Android does not release﻿ phones, Android is just an OS... How thick are some people haha. I've always said iPads are just an expensive rip off laptop/tablet, but I've got to admit I am very tempted to get one of these xD
garageband for free ????? wow, this is the biggest change﻿
You have to agree they know how to hype up their products. That's why people will give them their money. Where is a good camera, Flash, usb port, micro sd card, choice of widgets instead of scrolling icons, Swype keyboard, Google navigation (standalone gps style), better maps? They now have a notification bar, a﻿ cloud, some widgets and voice input on the keyboard, which were Android only features until not long ago. I like having more choice of what my device looks like and what﻿ I put on it.
It's not crap (anyone﻿ who says that is an idiot or a little kid) but their innovation days are not as bright as they used to be. They are falling behind on the OS and devices to Android because of their stubborn ways and the way they provide "daycare" to its customers. Btw, not the thinnest device, cloud was on Android first, same with widgets, navigation, voice input (recognition better than Siri), most new apps are in both stores, find my device was Android first (Wavesecure).
The new iPad has seriously not that great specs. Same CPU as the iPad 2, same kind of GPU, but with 4 cores instead of 2. 4 times the pixels. Do the math, the new iPad should be a bit slower/choppier than the iPad 2. Games will look better due to the screen, but the graphics will not be improved. I'm not saying that the new iPad is bad, it's just not﻿ as fantastic as many fanboys are saying it is. Nevertheless, I'm actually buying this iPad. The screen is mind-blowing!
lol, or just get an Android tablet with a micro usb port and micro sd card slot.. lol. They are just as smooth and do even more. That's the whole point. I don't understand why people still buy these things. My guess is because Apple marketing is very﻿ good.

It still doesn't have flash... It still costs 500$..... When will apple realise that we do not need a new camera?!!!! The resolution is so fucking good but do we really need it?? Also it has been the same design since the﻿ begining!!! and yet people still buy this shit... wtf people??
People are buying those because they do what People are expecting them to do without some hassle.About that Micro Card Slot: For what Reason would I need that Option if I can shoot a picture and it`s getting transferred to my Mac through iCloud﻿ the same Moment? To all Android User: Why I have to buy some Extra Drive or some Extra Micro-SD Card when I could simple sent the Picture or Video to my Mac without them? All those Costs are not needed anymore at least not with an Apple Device.
There are lots of tools for Android that do iOS things such as Vlingo for Siri. They are still not a native OS application. They are also not﻿ as refined as say Google Navigation which receives updates every week pretty much. OS native features tend to be more solid. Apple has good software and devices but their closed minded mentality is what bugs me. I guess it's for money and that's what companies care about; they exist just to make a profit in the end and they're doing that.
Dear Android Troll, this is your second Post and I won`t spent to much Time with you so I﻿ will make it quick: Goggle changed their Android Store System because it was the worst on the Market. Ask any Developer out there and you will get the same Answer if they compare it to "any" other Store System (Apple, Amazon). Currently the Apple iTunes Store is the leading Digital Shop Platform. Take a look at the Sale Stats and then compare it to those of the Old and New Android Market Place.
lol, thanks for that. Of course the Apple and Amazon stores are better. They are more matured software while Google Market is just coming out of its infancy. It will take time to develop and for Google to learn what works well and what﻿ doesn't. 7 years versus 2. Also Apple has world class marketing so even old people know of the itunes store. That's how they have the sales numbers they do. Android is nowhere near the same level and may never be cause the iTunes lead is too big.
This ipad have bigger resoliution than my monitor﻿ :D
Oh wow﻿ Apple has Super Amoled
Apple is amazing, even without jobs﻿ D;
iPad is awesome, it's because﻿ of the success of the ipad that samsung made their own
I am really starting to hate Apple haters. I don't own many of their products just a few but can't most people see Apple is the main bright spot carrying the US Economy. People can hardly sigh too much over the economy if one stellar company is yielding unprecedented﻿ performance. I mean for no other reason than as a focus point of success it deserves some credit. Believe me the collateral effect on tech stocks rising is duly noted as well, but Apple makes the industry itself look bountiful. Goo
ios 4﻿ ever!!
Grrrrrrrr I just got a 2 for﻿ Christmas!!!!
Haters, why is always apple one of the﻿ most valueable companys???? Becuz they are always 5-10 years in front of you
Just got my iPad in﻿ the mail I love it
Well... I have to say, they know how﻿ to sell a product.
Good﻿ products but seriously., I'm just gonna wait till June when the iPad 16 comes out.
Some people like you are so ignorant. Android DOES NOT need an antivirus; I don't know who drilled that into your head but it's not true. I have had Android since the beginning (~3years?)﻿ and have never had a problem. Also you are not any more protected against hackers, scams or spyware. Many iOS exploits found in the past btw. OSX has less viruses than Windows cause it's based on UNIX, the same is not true of iOS vs Android. Embedded systems are part of my area of study. :P:)
There are no more security concerns with iOS than there are with Android and ICS is awesome on a tablet btw. Honeycomb was less refined yes. Notice how each iteration advances so much as to﻿ give iOS (a 7 year old OS that still has scrolling rows of icons) a serious run for its money. There is a concern for all the Google manages info, but since iOS has a cloud now too you'll have the same thing. We have had a cloud as of ~ 2 years ago and the info has been fine so far.
Amazing technology! For de 1st time i'm becomin a﻿ fan of apple <3
The Brand is﻿ strong and they know how to sell it or when you have to push it to make it Stronger. Jobs did really a great Job with Apple and there is nothing wrong in honour it.
That Device still does Kick-ass. Trust Me you won`t regret it at any Time this Year. It`s a long Story but trust me that you will love it even while half of the Planet will use maybe already the new iPad because the iPad 2 was the first Tablet from Apple that had enough Power and also enough a great Display at the same﻿ Time if you compare it to the first iPad and Apple is currently still selling enough iPad 2 because that Device is as good as it could be for it`s Time.
It really does depend on what you are doing with your Android Device. I'm using both Worlds. A few from Apple and one Tablet from Samsung and I can only report you that both﻿ Worlds are great.
Sure there are not as many Games for the Android Platform as for the iOS One but there are still a few Great Games for the Android too. I even got my Samsung Tablet because﻿ of some Games that do launch on the Android Platform earlier then on the iOS so that should tell you that there are enough Games for both Platforms to make it worth getting One.
lol vimeo, not﻿ youtube! hahahaahaha
That's because Apple is not a technology developing company, it's a marketing company in large :P:). Very good at it but still. Everything else besides the OS is made by another company such as Samsung﻿ and Foxconn
So its like an ipad 2 witg﻿ new cool stuff Nice job though.. But u guys make new products too much with lil change
It's incredible that this new﻿ iPad has more pixels﻿ for﻿ images with sharper and﻿ clearer colors than 55 inches HDTVs.
I have been around technology about 15 years and am a systems and computing engineer (hardware, software, mechatronics and electronics). Also proficient in advanced programming :P:) lol, ICS Android is very﻿ smooth. You probably used Android in its infancy. Why iOS is smooth is because of openGL hardware acceleration which is not present in Android. My Galaxy Nexus is butter smooth and can do real multitasking instead of asking for time from the CPU.. lol
Also that it looks like a million bucks is subjective. I think it looks antiquated with its scrolling icons (in Android that is the app drawer) and no options of real widgets which are very nice to have btw. I commend you for using all those OS and device combinations but iOS is if anything now comparable to Android but is lagging behind in many respects. One of those is UI, where iOS used to be﻿ king. Times change.. :)
The vast majority of the new Android handsets run very well. They respond very fast and run smoothly. You might be a bit behind the times. There will be some that are slower but that's an extra choice for people that can't afford a really high end﻿ smartphone and by no means a bad option. Choice is a good thing.
Apple, I love you to death, but FU in the face for not including﻿ this on the IPAD 2!
I love Apple & I love this new iPad, they they say technology is at its best when its invisible, however if you make something thicker and heavier its﻿ not necessarily making their point.
This thing is really awesome. I have it check out my unboxing.girls stop sending me your panties you can't get﻿ my ipad3
I LOVE U APPLE ♥﻿
You still could﻿ wait the Year to get it $100 cheaper or get instead an iPad 2. Overall don`t forget that there are Android Tablets out there too so you could take a look at those too but most People I have talked with that did take a look at the new iPad Screen don`t wanna go back to the iPad 2 or some Android Tablets of the current Generation...
i don't get it, i don't see anything innovative, still a dual core cpu, same design ?!?! EXPENSIVE. the only thing they added to iPad was the resolution and i admit﻿ that this is cool..but they are late with technology, if they wanted to make it outstanding they should put a quad core, a different design, a different looking os this new ipad is like iphone 4s...a disappoint
I love using﻿ my new iPad 3 :) Cant wait to try Infinity blade 2
Damn i got a ipad﻿ 2 64 gb last year :(
If it was cheaper, it would be a PC product.﻿
Well thank you﻿ for making me rant to my parents because I have the 2G
I love apple more than any tablets out their..though apple is not likely changing the looks of their products, but still they are the first one to build a gadget that others will surely follow..like the iPAD, it is the very first tablet that was made, and so when other makers of gadget saw﻿ it, they came up with their own tablets. In reality, apple is always the first in all gadgets.
e. Shut up? Dude if you would've read all the comments I said apples marketing and iOS is getting old. Apple is doing good I can't lie. But they're starting to lack in many things. I own a iPod touch and my phone﻿ is android. So I do support iOS,but they need to bring something new to the table. Android has variety which is what I'm about. Apple has quantity which is okay to i guess.
I simply love apple. I love the structur and the many things I can do with my mac. And honestly I don't care how many people spend their whole time fighting each other just because of two or three different brands. I mean why do people keep fighting over apple vs PC vs Google. I mean this is just some sort of personal preference. Only "Foodball or Soccer" or "Foodball vs Hockey" are topics to fight about so heavily beside that. I just don't like Google for many reasons but thats only my opinion.﻿
its not that the﻿ new ipad sucks but i mean common throughout the entire video u talking about little marginal improvement, that other tablets have done for almost a year now the new display is great but as for the other parts the 4g wireless is on every device and lets get really realistic u will not realistically every gonna use the camera dont really dislike the new ipad but the promo is like the typical apple bullshit
Good work apple, always as﻿ expected quality products!
apple owns the market﻿ when it comes up to things like the ipad, iphone ect. and there is a reason for that ;)
Im an avid Apple user, and I absolutely adore my Ipad, but it really was a huge mistake for Jobs to not even include a stinking manual... Now let﻿ me say I am IMMENSELY tech savvy, and do everything from scripting, design, to hardware repair. But this site I stumbled upon literally showed me things I would have NEVER even known were possible with my Ipad. Do yourself a favor and check it out, it's well worth your time: everyipadsecret.info
The new Market Place aka Google Play is a good Restart. Still not﻿ as good as the iTunes Store itself but at least Google is trying to improve the hole thing. I really hope that they will someday reach the Level of the iTunes Store.
Sorry you got that 30% Fact wrong. Apple doesn`t take anything from you if your App is below or equal a Special Price Tag! Look the biggest Problem with the Android Market Place are as following: - More then 800 different Devices. (If you are a Developer you will spent more Time for Support then actually on Working on your own App) - Piracy. ( It`s currently so High that a﻿ few Developer I have talked to about that topic makes them don`t port their App and in my Eyes this is Googles fault.
GOT ONE THE OTHER﻿ DAY!!! I LOVE it!!
That's a﻿ lot of mega pixels. P.s. this comment has been sent by the new ipad
Just﻿ got mine. It's amazing!
Why bother to comment? you clearly know crap all. Its got the highest resolution that has ever been﻿ seen, hows that the same as an ipad2? Try watching the video.
Who will tell the weakness in own advertisement lol=.= Btw Apple The new ipad owned once again, 1st day launch sold 300 million unit worldwide. 1st﻿ day lolx, Samsung Galaxy tab's sales since it lauch until now also nowhere near the amount..
The "Retina" screen makes video somehow look better than the resolution of the source video?! NO! good for ebooks and viewing photos "Thicker and heavier than iPad 1 or 2! High heat quad-core GPU to support gimmicky screen! 100% markup on manufacturing and parts cost on the base model (like all apple products)! STILL lacking sd card support so you can overpay for 32GB and 64GB models! It is a great﻿ mobile point of sale platform for iTunes! buy it because we told you to! Apple: be a sheep"
I have to say these are nifty,﻿ handy, relevant, smart and intuitive pieces of work. I don't buy into the cult-like nature of apple. I didn't queue for a night to get 'the new iPad' but I do have 1. Never had 1 before, nor have I used an apple product. 'I'm a PC' as the ads say. But, 4 what I use the tablet 4 works 4 me. It doesn't heat up badly or give me any grief. It probably is thicker but what do you want from technology? Sadly they are made by slaves, essentially. Double edged sword..
I'd also like to add that this constant bickering between techno geeks is tiring and 'trollish'. Weigh up what you want from a tablet or laptop and choose what works for you. I love my games, so I'd never buy a tablet or mac﻿ for an aesthetic like that. I digitally paint, write, blog, tweet, photograph, video and watch movies on the tablet. As well as music. But I play my games on the PC, obviously. I have to add, not thati t matters that constantly saying 'ipad iphone i' is like saying ME ME ME.
yeah it is beutifull, i know it, because﻿ i write this text on my new iPad ;)
It looks greats but id﻿ like a new ipod touch
I﻿ LOVE 
i bought an ipad 3﻿ a week ago, (32gb wifi /4g) not too heavy and it desent heat up, but it is very easily scratched on the back, and the screen will shatter into a million pieces if dropped from below waist height !!! its rather slippery and not to comfortable to hold at times, if anything, its too thin, needs a leatther case, then it should be ok battery lasts about 7 hrs, not bad.. both the cameras are shit, screen is pretty good overall i like it much more that i thought i would
The only Apple product beside﻿ iPod I'd like to have
﻿ best company
Just got this Ipad!﻿ it's Very GREAT! I really Love it :) Very very happy with this Ipad! No problems :D Really recommend this!
Apple products stink they only pot in what the consumer wants as for a technical PC it can be used for many things that a Mac can't do if you own a Mac or iPad try to download something .... Most of the time it won't work because it is for a PC. It's a good idea﻿ but they need to fix that and put it into business proportions not only what users want but everything they can offer. Apple can be better.
amazing﻿ iPad, better than other tablet
More than gadget. Apple﻿ is lifestyle
NEW iPAD is﻿ so seductive...
I was just looking at the first generation ipad.....its kinda﻿ ugly now lol
i love my new ipad :)﻿
iPad is soooo great.It looks so﻿ beautiful.Its my dream
I own all three and I can tell you that they all are great Devices. No Reason to regret anything if you got﻿ the first One.
I﻿ just got mine 32GB + Cellular yesterday, LOVE IT!!
ipad 3﻿ is best
I have the IPad 3 its amazing﻿
thumbs up if you have the new﻿ iPad
2:10 shut up﻿ and take my money.
Thanks ! I love it so much ! it the best thing ever !﻿
I might have to be broke for a while but.. I wouldn't mind going into a little debt for this. (college student, only work on weekends, not including friday) I just bought the﻿ iPhone 4s a few weeks ago (1st apple product) and it's pretty amazing. I've always hated apple, because I know their history and plus I'm a big linux user. (hate windows even more than apple) so yeah..in a nut shell lol
As much as I dont like Apple there is no other tablet that even﻿ comes close to this one.
Microsoft Will never never be﻿ better than apple really!!!
Thanks Apple for reinventing tablets. Yes, you stole people's ideas﻿ but you made them better. Only after you release iPad, companies rush to release something like it. Only after you had retina display, other companies start to make displays with super-dense poi
True.﻿ But Apple will ALWAYS remain one of the most popular/well-known company in the world for this type of stuff (smartphones, tablets...)
The iPad is﻿ truly amazing and I love Apple too.
I LOVE my iPad it's faster﻿ than the samshit tab
nice cant wait for the ipad 3﻿
ALL the tablets are really good out their but I'm typing on my iPad. im sticking wit my iPad. I even heard﻿ that the Microsoft surface is pretty good too :)
Oh yeah i was at best buy 2 days ago and i was plaing on yhe new ipad3 and the picture was crystal clear and i really was shocked how the screen felt and how the pictures looked good job apple﻿ cant wait to get my ipad
i wish i could afford this one but i can only afford the second﻿ one. still cool tho!
Just got one, it's amazing! I use the Siri﻿ dictation to type this :-)
You don`t need a powerful Netbook if all what you do with it is read your Mails/Write your Letters/Chat with your Family/Do your normal Office Stuff during being on the Road by using a Bluetooth Keyboad...you know just do the usual Stuff. Tablets are Perfect for that type of Stuff. A Net-Book/Powerbook would be totally an Overkill for those kind of things and probably even put some﻿ more Weight on the Day. It doesn`t matter which Brand - Tablet`s are Part of our Future...
IPad the first﻿ one
apple the best.﻿
APPLE FOREVER! <3 I don't think any tablet can actually match the standards of Apple iPad 3. I mean come on.. it has got the best of apple's apps, like facetime, itunes and stuff! and what else? It gives u whole 10 hours of battery life! Yes﻿ it does cost a big packet but it is worth the last penny of it and mind you, I don't have an iPad 3 yet.. :)
Thanks u﻿ apple
IPad 3﻿ is really cool
my whole school gets ipads!!!!!! so fricken﻿ awesome
I'm watching this﻿ with my iPad. It's amazing especially with cellular data plan
I just bought this awesome devices 4 days back and its really good, i am having a total new﻿ experience of IPAD 3, loved it ;-)
omg , this is﻿ real technology
very nice,, love﻿ apple.
never d universal d fastest d glorious ever d universe produced d huge xtreme engineering concepts nothing cud impress me bt nly u apple made me impress dat i jumped on d tree grab it ate lyk u was hungry 4 yrs love u﻿ apple my best f d best my smart f d smart os
I do not know how good is this Ipad but,how they are giving responses IN the video,I guess its amazing﻿
ipad 3﻿ display is really amazing!!!
Resolution is fucking awesome! Incredibly quick and easy to use.﻿
end of the day ipad is the best tablet, I know because I've used android tablets having owned one and working in an electric store meaning i have had used other tablets a lot and none of them come close to the ipad, price is important but they are all priced at a similar price to the ipad anyway, if money is an issue then get﻿ the ipad 2 or the ipad 1! however they don't change much with each generation so when you have one you don't need to upgrade, i still have the first ipad and it is great.
i﻿ love ipad
i can see my﻿ small tiny pixels on my computer
nothing wrong with android. I like it, but me personally i like the ipad 3 more. But dont﻿ get me wrong the Acer is a great tablet
i﻿ love ipad
best apps﻿ in the world
It's just so amazing. Man, if people hate apple﻿ products, why do they watch their trailers then? Don't Hate ! Appreciate. bi*chez.
Was trying this out last Saturday in stores. It﻿ wasn't bad but it was pretty heavy! :O
I bought. this @ best buy, I love it so much. It goes great﻿ with my Evo 4G
wow USB﻿ port nice.
Feature wise ipad2 cant﻿ even compare, so I'm going to get an android tablet, I just can't decide between getting this now or wait for the transformer.
wow a tablet that﻿ actually has everything customers been wanting and its 50$ less then a ipad 2 and much powerful and better cameras.. i wounder what excuse apple people will have to convince themselves that apple is worth 500$ for the same tablet as last yr.
900 BGN makes it the cheapest good tablet on the Bulgarian﻿ market, but it's too much compromise to live with. Samsung 10.1v pretty much obliterates everything but the ipad 2.
!!!The 720p video is far better than﻿ the Asus Transformer, you guys suck when it comes to reviewing.
Compared to this Iconia Tab A500,the ipad is crappy.Long﻿ live Acer.
Acer ICONIA Tab A500 is﻿ the BEST tablet. Who agrees with me?
i agree with﻿ you ;) really cool tablet
both very good tablets I got﻿ the iconia
Is cheap, with Honeycomb, large battery life, great display,﻿ 2 cameras, USB PORT!! Dear Santa!! :D
WTF are you talking about? Who uses an SD card slot on a frequent basis? Seriously? Talk about someone who needs to bone﻿ up on technical aspects. Look in the mirror pal. That slot and the USB ports are the two single options that set this tab apart from the Asus. Not to mention a much better build quality from what I'm reading on amazon reviews. Got some advice for you, go back to your Ipad fan boy.
I just bought this tablet and is much better I﻿ thought, especially for it's price, however if you can afford another tablet like a Xoom, you should definately go for it.
Bought one three days ago. Very happy with it for the money.﻿ So far I've had no bad experiences except a few aps that don't work well on a pad instead of a cell phone. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend one!
why does﻿ everyone hate the clock its not bad looking
yeh, I thought the blue clock looked good! it﻿ does right?
clock﻿ is nice
very good﻿ tablet.....but you can dawnload games from market for free..?
Ok , i made my﻿ mind up. You have convinced me to buy this acer iconia tablet. Next week i'm going to start saving for it. and hopefully in about 2 months I will be able to purchase. Thank you for your wonderful review.
I﻿ love it..10times cooler than HP Touchpad(which turned out to be a disappointment)..:))
I really love this thing. I've owned one for a couple weeks now. It's fantastic. I was convinced over the zoom. the USB allowed me to purchase a small USB wireless keyboard,﻿ and I bought a picture frame stand for 4.99 at target and I feel like I am using a "touch netbook". It's really neat!
Got mine Friday and love it. Got the﻿ iPad 2 also. I really like this.
Perfect video. I love this tablet. Im going﻿ to buy it soon thanks to your wonderful review. Subscribed and thumbed up. :)
This was $350 at Target, pretty﻿ good deal!
This Tab is going to be $399 at Target this weekend. PLUS Target is giving away $50 gift cards with the purchase of one...not﻿ a bad deal.
I must say, after having this tablet for 3 weeks it was an excellent buy. It may be﻿ slightly hefty but it really shows its value in its performance; very high quality build. Just need a screen protector to cut down on fingerprint marks.
This looks way cooler than the ipad,camera front and back,nice,the﻿ interface looks clean and nice-----keep up the good work acer.
getting this﻿ today for only 300 it was in a ad for staples for 400 then they gave us a 100 buck coupon so really works out.
its really awesome! the screen isn't as plasticcy as he said.﻿
yes its a Great tablet, i have it. and i havent heard of a defective 1 yet. and if ure afraid of getting another tablet then i would﻿ go with an ipad 2 becuz they usually r never defective but cost a little extra:) hope tht helped
I ummmed and ahhhed whether to get this, the ipad or the Asus. I am﻿ happy with my choice so far, the addition of the USB is very good
so epic. thank you acer for making such an epic and affordable product.﻿ :D getting it very soon.
no its ot tat would have to go to the acer even though its supposed to be﻿ a cheaper talet...it has the ips screen so does the galaxy tabs...but where the galaxy tab gets killed is no sd card slot
The USB port it's what﻿ it makes better the "iconia a500"
I'd like to have one ﻿
nice﻿ gadget
I﻿ have one and love it!!
this one is better i think. i'm gonna get this one:) i first wanted the ipad, but﻿ now i like this more
nope ipad got RAPED﻿
i like﻿ this one!! =)
I got the Acer Iconia A500 on a pre-Black Friday sale at Staples for 299. I looked at the screen in Best Buy and Staples and didn't see any scratches on the screens in the stores, where they are constantly abused. Filthy but not scratched. I'm an Expert screen scratcher and for the 2 or so days that I had it without a screen protector I﻿ was not able to scratch it. So not sure what they do to the tabs to scratch the screens. So far I really like this tablet especially for the price I paid.
everybody's so critical but it﻿ really is a great tablet
after looking at tablets for a week﻿ straight I settled for this one and I don't regret it at all. its a bit heavy but that makes it feel more durable than other tablets..
Only losers trade their android device and get the﻿ iPad 2. The Iconia Tab has way lot more features than the iPad. The iPad is smooth because it's lack of features. Such as widgets, ports, full customization etc. BOOO ! Android Tablets FTW ! P.s bad review
I WANT IT SOO BAD !!! anyone giving it away for free﻿ :) ?
For $229.99? I would say this is an amazing deal.﻿
it rocks. can use a﻿ mouse with it on the latest andrioid up date as well, and bluetooth keyboard
this is a very cool tablet and i like﻿ android too
I GOT THIS ON﻿ A BID ON EBAY FOR $175 16 GB AND IT IS AWESOME
just got﻿ a refurbished model at bestbuy for 299 great tablet better then the ipad love the fact that you can add more memory through sd micro and usb drives
I have the Acer Iconia Tab A100 and it has the exact﻿ same specifications as the A500. And about the screen, i think Acer uses low quality one because there are some flex on it each time i put some pressure and the display will get distorted. But its very sensitive. Sorry for my bad english lololol.
All I have read about the A500 is good reviews very, very few bad and usually the bad reviews had little to﻿ do with the actual product, I'm getting ready to purchase a tablet and have been researching on every brand and type. So far the Acer tablet seems to be the better buy, at least for everything I need. I have read from the Corning website that it has Gorilla glass. This review sold it for me.
i got this﻿ tablet today and im returning it, really its a really nicely made tablet but its too heavy and thick, if you dont mind about that its just fine, but im getting the samsung galaxy tab 8.9
This sounds like a great tablet. awesome review. I am thinking about getting one, i dont mind the bulk and i﻿ wont use camera or recording often so i set, again great review
I've been using this tab for 5 months now, I totally recommend it; it's solid, the﻿ speakers are pretty nice (except for the lack of bass), the screen is really good, FULL SIZED USB PORT, and stock Honeycomb (3.2). However, I totally recommend buying a case for anyone who buys it, since any drop from 0.5 meters or above will damage the casing a bit. If you're looking for an affordable Honeycomb tablet, this is the tab you would like to buy.
The unit has been updated to the latest Honeycomb build. THe good new is it will be the first or one of the first to have Android 4.0﻿ Startig nJanuary 2012 as the internal builds are done, and the vip beta has completed already.
I don't want to start a apple vs. android fight I like both, but you don't have to﻿ put in credit card info to download apps. You can set up your apple id without setting up credit card info.
i got one for Christmas and i love it. i put a screen protector on mine as soon as i got it and it took the glare from the screen...... it downloads really fast. with the 16 GB it came with and i was able to add another 32 GB SD card and i am good to go to put just about anything i want...... i am still adding apps and setting it up but i would have﻿ to say i haven't found any problems with it yet. i will post later if i run into any problem for those that are looking to buy one,
good﻿ but sucks. asus eee pad tranformer prime is the best nowaday tablet
Got this boxing day!!! its great. a tiny bit heavy. also i got it a lot cheaper than 450. 399.99 for the 32GB model. 166 was 349.99. wanted to get the 64GB model but they sold out before my part of the line got through the door. it was on sale for 399 at $100 off. :'( deff want a case﻿ for it
Just got this to day, Its an Awsome Tablet running Android﻿ ver. 3.2.1 im loven it:)
I have the﻿ 8gb and love it, however now that I know that apps cannot save to SD card like they do on my phone I would strongly recommend a larger internal memory.
This was a very good review, thank you. Only problem I had was in the beginning, As the tablet is bulky Its perfect for someone with big hands. The "paper" tablets out are very uncomfortable in my hands while the Acer is a lot more comfortable. While the reviewer did a good job he should have mention that this tablet "MAY" be comfortable to﻿ someone with large hands. But anyone looking for a tablet should do research then goto the local best buy and try the tablet them selves. Just my two cents.
Acer A500: Leave Out All The Rest﻿ :)
.... your right about the battery 3260 mAh, but i use it all the time & have used it to stream videos and play games,surf the net & just about anything i want to do with it and my man played a game on it the other day for like 7 hrs & it still had a lot of battery life. so it differently has the 8 hrs of battery life or more﻿ as it says it does. i love it and take it every where i go. i haven't had any trouble connecting to the internet defiantly a GREAT buy.
I got this for﻿ 270 great deal loving it :-)
Awesome!I am getting one of those for my﻿ birthday!
right now these are at﻿ walmart and bestbuy for under 300 if you dont mind going with refurbished and just about 350 if you want brand new at walmart. just saying they arent all that expensive considering.
I actually got this, and I prefer the﻿ look and feel to anything else out.
if i was smartx i rather get this﻿ to my current shitty a100
I have this tablet and I love﻿ it
Mann I got the a500﻿ and its awesome....I love it :-)
Galaxy tab has a slightly﻿ better screen, but this one is usually a few hundred less (so a much better value) plus a full size usb!
motorla xoom has a slightly better screen and is slightly smaller (more portable), but the iconia tab has a full sized usb port and is usually much cheaper so I'd recommend the iconia tab!﻿
oh yes m8 =) I﻿ know this since I purchased it and I gotta say it's great, for the price 235 U$s and it's performance! great review
its awesome, i'm using it right now. i highly recommend﻿ it, it's fast, and the camera is brilliant , the appstore is huge, and it's very good at browsing. it may not be as light as the ipad, but for all the browsing and stuff, it works like a dream
besides being kind of heavy I haven't﻿ found anything to compete with this. with the 5mp camera with led flash, micro SD slot and all the other features I really like this tab. I would like something a little smaller and lighter but I can't find anything as good as this.
i like it because they got nvidia tegra 2 for gaming awesome graphic.﻿
Just like any other﻿ Acer devices: GREAT PRICE, GREAT QUALITY, IMPRESSIVE, INNOVATIVE...
I﻿ like the Archos G9 101's customizations for media a lot more. Unfortunately, everything else on it sucks. The reviews make it out to be good quality for its low price, but the Archos G9 101 does not work at all. It crashes so often, shuts off, and takes like 5 minutes to turn back on. it makes me want to kill myself. On top of all that, the USB port stopped working. I'm telling all of you this because I'm about to get the Acer Iconia A500 Tab instead. Archos G9 101, no Archos sucks.
its pretty durable. I saw one in best buy all beat﻿ up and the screen still had no scraches.
I'm﻿ looking for a tablet that I can draw on (with a stylus) and kind of use as an artist tablet. I found a refurbished iconia a500 at walmart and the price is $230. I think this'll be a good tablet fr me!
My God, that thing looks gorgeous!! You see, I have a little problem. I came across a store sale of the Blackberry playbook. I only took it because in total the cost was $147. However, I have a tonne of problems with it. Wifi drops, tablet doesn't always connect to pc, apps do not launch sometimes. And this happens to me like 4 times a day!!! My﻿ question is does that Acer tablet give you problems like mine, or the Android OS is much more stable?
ipad killer!﻿ i love acer tablets because of the quality and design.
i love my tablet. X3 its awesome.﻿ i let my lil bro use it and he dropped it and not a scratch. awesomeness. plus i like the design and the way it works. the live wallpapers are amazing too :3
I have this tablet and ii`s awesome probably﻿ challenges ipad 2, asus Eee pad tansformer, samsung galaxy 10.1
This tablet﻿ is a little outdated now (almost 2 years I think) Only has tega 2. Still a decent tablet, but I'd currently wait for the 32 gb nexus 7
I have one of these and i like it a lot! The only thing that i don't like in articular is the weight specially when you're lying down in bed and watching Netflix: it tends to be heavy and will tire both of your hands while holding it when you're watching.Other than the weight,It's great tablet and it will always Upgrades and it promps you the user. It's Android OS so it's pretty much complete. Maybe i'll get the Google Nexus 7 after this but for now, it's still great as a﻿ tablet!
maybe with icecream sandwich we'll see progress in that direction as well. I believe they focused their efforts towards making android more reliable and more stable, and they traveled a long way since april with HoneyComb. The issue with apps though is still there but for the first time lately, especially after also seeing the galaxy tab 10.1 which i﻿ hope to review next week, i feel like Android can be an alternative to iOS and ipad 2
GORILLA﻿ GLASS BOO YEAHHH!!!!
I bought one end of Oct. 2011. After 5﻿ days of standard use, it started resetting at random times. Technical support in Israel gave an unprofessional handling. I regret this purchase, though it has a cool user interface. Don't buy if you live in Israel.
its very heavy... but looking good, and solid.. but i﻿ a little bid confius either this gadget want to be a tablet or notebook?
I agree. Android is really unstable and not reliable.. Me owning both an iOS and Android tablets, phones, etc. I've found that since the﻿ Ice Cream Sandwich update (4.0.3) They have moved it to the most stable thing I've ever seen experienced with Android so far. Android will really be kicking with their 5.0 Jelly-Bean (Released rumors Q3 2012) and 6.0 Key-Lime Pie (Released rumors Q2 2013)
Wonderful review Michael. G-slate﻿ is sexy.
Good thing I have 3D﻿ glasses near my desk at all times. :-)
: I agree, I love android but all of these tablets﻿ (including xoom) seems to be running a public beta version of what honeycomb could be.
Love my G--slate!﻿
You are looking to get on average around 8 hours. You can get more or less depending on how intensive your use is. Really suprised at the battery life considering﻿ the price of the tab.
I have﻿ a HANNspree, it's great :) really good quality !
I just bought one of these, it seems actually really﻿ good.
Wow, I just rooted﻿ it with z4root! SWEET
@skrbicdu iPad is less expensive .... and﻿ Xoom is AWESOME iPad sucks
ha yea after clicking your link like forty times, thought you were talking about the load-screen at first. still probably less laggy then most 6-month-old windows machines. and the fact that it took you 6 minutes out of the 10 to find the﻿ slightest lag makes it sound good to me
I still think it's a great device and want it. the only problem for me is the steep price. Also why do these things not have more space? I remember iPods with over 100 gigs but we can get a tablet with high space? Thats kinda a turn off for me. I still﻿ would like to buy this even with the price but I fear there is a better, cheaper, tab around the corner running Android 3.0
Nah I like the﻿ 10'' display.
all the game work on a xoom!??? or have a olny games work!! gunstar is work and other games﻿
LOL way to put a﻿ windows aero backround on a google device!
@Seanvdodge this its powered by Nvidia Tegra 2 and that meants u﻿ can play all those shity games and beyond cuz this can run any game with ureal engine take that applelover
Xooms great, I just went through four iPad 2,s in the last two days and they all had atleast one﻿ dead pixel
its great to use when playing a friend i put all my fingers on the﻿ screen (when im in the lead) and my friends swipes dont register haha
god i﻿ want this it looks way more smooth than ipad 2 ......
nice vid man.just about to buy a﻿ tablet its this or the thrive what you think?? i think the xoom.but not sure
i'm saving up for one of these and working on m turk a lil﻿ bit to earn some extra cash to purchase this. between this and the ps vita this year will be expensive i suppose
getting﻿ one for my birthday !!!
This thing is awesome!!!!﻿ I hope i'll get one in a couple of weeks... ;))
this is way better than the ipad...i think its worth getting tho, fuck apple﻿ lmao
i want to get the﻿ xoom
What kind of case do you have on the Xoom? I am﻿ looking for one just like it.
Thank you brother - I was hoping for a stand with USB ports, but the device seem to﻿ rock anyway.
Actually the screen on the EP121 is excellent, it uses a proprietary LCD technology called AFFS+ and is the rival of IPS in terms﻿ of viewing angles. Most laptops in this price range don't have as good of a display.
160 degress of view angle, bright display, standard 1280 by 600 resolution, how is asus a trashy﻿ monitor?
I have had two Asus laptops so far and have been﻿ very happy with the monitors. Good o hear this unit too, has a good screen.
@curtsphobias it﻿ is like double the price of the ipad, but it still powns it, windows powns.!
@curtsphobias is a ipad good for school= NOT. cuz you can't use all those programs like, vmware. Windows tablet = 4 GB + I5 = YES, good for working.﻿
yea, at the last moment they ''deleted''﻿ it, it was so badass, like the asus transformer much better than the acer iconia w500.
..yep i bout mine for the $450 price..it works great..this﻿ table is just waiting for Honeycomb to drop !! :)
better then apple﻿ ipad and also cheaper then ipad 2 and great look
i shall buy that﻿ in a month its a cool tablet
it is flash optimized﻿
iam so happy i figured out how to call on my streak 7 and﻿ take stage ui off, and it looks really good!!!!!!!
No,﻿ no, no. Streak is the way to go. Robert Lichota
I like 7"﻿ tablets over bigger ones. Great video!
Its﻿ totaly worth it !! If you want it.. Take it !
Great review and a great tablet, only thing i﻿ think its missing is an AMOLED screen, but thats just me!
IPad sucks, trust me﻿ i have one! Get this or samsung galaxy tab
Your wife is absolutely gonna﻿ love that Tegra 3 processor!
Now I am set to﻿ pre-order the champagne it just look flawless.
Looks like﻿ a great laptop replacement.
After having my ipadmone for a year I﻿ really want the prime the iPad's ios5 is supper crappy and just crap the browser crashes atleast 3 times a day and there is a lot of lag
Alright, I'll admit, this is﻿ the first tablet to actually make me feel like it could be more useful than a laptop (particularly with the dock). I see a lot of potential in this. Good job Asus.
How could you state﻿ that the software was a problem when everyone is well aware that this is going to be updated to ICS before years end, adding even more stability to this already amazing tab? Ontop of that I didn't hear many problems that would cause you to dislike the current software, and why did you recommend the Ipad afterwards? It seems as if you loved the tablet until the ending. These are honest questions that puzzled me about the video as I am currently a happy Ipad 2 owner myself.
Wow, this may be the﻿ first Android Tablet that truly looks worth buying, props to Asus
Apple have great products but just too much overprice milking. They did a great job marketing to brainwash people. I go with android cause it's easier to use. ﻿ Such as flash, easy to move files, support more files format.
Wow, come on Joanna. ICS will release before people even notice Honeycomb as a problem; hence, a non-issue. I love the iPad 2, but I am a programmer and a video nut that works with several different codecs. Apple only allows their native codec: h.264. That gets annoying on the go when I need to take a file that is not in that codec such as .avi! Customizability is a must!﻿ Apple is very "socialist" in this manner as they want the same vanilla experience for all. It's just not cutting it for me.
Apple = easy to use media device for the non-serious user. Programmers and more serious people who desire customizability go with Android. Both are great and have entirely different uses.﻿ So how can you compare something like a PC to a Mac? lol Mac = good video rendering for artists. PC = engineering for the world. Even Apple designs it's own products on PC! Seen it myself.
My money will go to Asus this tablet is amazing and for what I need it for the Apps﻿ on Android is just enough besides that is a process that is growing and growing. BTW nice video.....
What's with all this complaining about Honeycomb lack of apps? I have no problems finding all the apps I need for my Galaxy Tab and the os is great, in my opinion. I am a power user and used lots of﻿ apps. Looking forward to 4.0. Still think this meme shared by many reviewers of supposedly not enough apps is bogus.
I seriously think that rating it down because of the OS wasn't fair. While Honeycomb really isn't as smooth of an experience as I thought it would be (I've tried a Galaxy Tab 10.1, and I was blown away from the lag), but﻿ ICS should really fix it,just look at the Galaxy Nexus, it did wonders with it. And about the app selection: ICS should take care of it too, making the apps smart,so all the phone apps will work AND look great on tablets.The style was super though,The Verge really nails it!
Does the dock really add 10 hours? So you﻿ can supposedly get 21 hours when docked? Amazing.
What gets me is the amount of space and price. I can get a﻿ 32gb for the same price as a 16gb ipad. Plus external storage... By the way this was a great review.
really the﻿ ipad 2 is better than honeycomb? are you crazy
She didnt say that. She just said﻿ that if one wants more applications the ipad 2 is a go. I am a Android guy btw...:)
the prime is better then﻿ the ipad even the transfromer is
Ipad 2 is NOTHING to compare to ASUS TRANSFORMER PRIME... Hardware & software are advance in ASUS TRANSFORMER PRIME. Ipad 2 is﻿ all hype & have the most basic and simplest operating system in all tablets,floating square thingy in the screen with NO CUSTOMIZATION & HALF ASS MULTITASKING... Only imoron & istupid defend it, like an izombie...
OMG! ipad better then Asus prime? what are you smoking? which planet are you﻿ coming from? i'm guessing applefan constellation :/
iPad?..... not so much. The prime blows it out of the﻿ water!!!
Is the constellation supposed to be the planet or the drug? It's not often that you see someone fail to answer their own question. Anyway, the point being made is that Honeycomb has yet to be able to compete with the﻿ iPad in terms of tablet-specific apps; as tablets are, at this point, media consumption devices, apps matter. I love my Transformer, but I'm not in denial about its faults. It's one thing to like a device, but another thing entirely to worship it.
Transformer Prime > iPad 2 You wait until this monster﻿ gets Ice Cream Sandwich. Apple will be shitting their pants.
I'm about to cry. It's so beautiful :'-) It's everything I ever wanted.﻿ This will be my first tablet and netbook.
Beating it? In sales, hell yeah! They matter when it comes to the quality of the product! /sarcasm. The reason why they sell well is because sheep like you don't understand what superior technology is, and only give a shit about the fact that you have a bitten apple logo on the﻿ back. Keep with your child friendly, massive iPod. People like you don't deserve to embrace quality technology.
regarding the apps for tablets and the marketing of their products apple﻿ is still leading...just look how many times asus postponed the release date of the prime...thats a shame...they gonna lose the biggest chance, the christmas sales...but in total i think we'll see a big progress next year...just look how many brands are already selling android based tablets...i'm looking forward and i'm just waiting for the release in germany...
I can't find any use of it, as I got a notebook and a﻿ smartphone, but﻿ damn, I just want it!
most inaccurate and fan based review i've ever seen! hating on﻿ android will prevent you from enjoying the best laptop/tablet that is going to hold it's place for a long time with open source Google android!
Honestly this looks chic. Aluminium or Plastic? I go﻿ with Aluminium
why the FUCK would you﻿ compare iPad and this amazing tablet?
So sad my Transformer was stolen. Loved it, but still won't buy a new tablet until﻿ it can do more. Windows 8 tablets are looking pretty damn good so far, but we will see.
lol thats still an awsome buy, considering the first﻿ transformer still beats alot of the tablets out there
I know.. and the ironic part is that the Transformer Prime is cheaper and Has a better hardware than the iPad 2﻿ !!
I really don't understand, lol. So because we don't have to pay for Android, that validates its obvious disadvantage with regards to tablet-specific apps when compared to iOS? Again, the point I was making was that, for all﻿ the people complaining about "OMG SHE R MENTIONING IPADZ", the comparison is pretty valid. Yes, the Prime has fifteen cores and and a Jesus Display, but iOS still has more tablet-specific apps- and with tablets being consumption devices, apps matter.
Will soon be the best operating system ever Android Ice Cream﻿ Sandwich
This is going to be a beast.when rooted, and put a﻿ custom rom onto it.
i think that you can't compare the Asus transformer prime with the iPad 2 witch is like a year older then this. the technology﻿ has improved more from when the iPad was made, but don't get me wrong. am not a fanboy of apple, in fact getting the Asus for Christmas this year so :)
Apple bias, you cant even compare this to the apple ipad 2 every feature﻿ on it is better e.g. processor, keyboard, camera ect...
@namename888888 Did you watch the ending, they said the ipad 2 was the better buy - despite the Transformer Prime beating the specs of anything iPad, iphone, or itouch related. Oh and Ice Cream Sandwich is going to be fantastic and new despite the blown﻿ up phone os on the ipad 1/2 that apple hasn't deviated from since the inception of iphone. While Microsoft and Google are trying to innovate - Apple stays behind the time and still herds sheep.
... Apples tablet/small devices were popular and the Only go to device... WERE is the word.﻿ Android is becoming quite popular to the fact that it has 47% share in the market now and continuing to growing. Sorry to say this but like anything in life - you can only be top dog for so long before someone 1ups ya. Sony and its PlayStation brand were top dog in regards to sales yet Xbox 360 came out of no where and has sold more than the PS3.
you﻿ guys love the I pad 2 too much, Asus prime is the way to go this season, why? because there will be an update coming soon to the prime (ice scream sandwich ) which will make the tablet even more faster than what it is now already and 50 times faster than the I pad 2. So over all this is the tablet for any body who wants to buy a tablet.
software is lacking? what a joke...why even mention﻿ the ipad? this tablet is much more functional.
Lol he'll be singing a different tune when ICS makes its way unto Android tablets﻿ everywhere Ultimately dooming the last bastion of excuses for the ipad to call itself "superior"
@Doggydude49 I own both consoles by the way (da1writer1985 for﻿ Gamertag, da1writer for PSN), I was just trying to show an example of a company always being on top but then an underdog comes out of no where to topple it eventually (or at least be neck and neck).Apple may have been top dog for a couple of years in regards to the ipad but as stated before, Android is becoming quite poplar to the point of being 47% of the mobile market share now. Tablets like this make it even better.
WAY﻿ better than iPad !
I love this tablet but i hate android, android apps are not good enought to make use of this beast, they are still laggy,poor UI and give unexpected errors like installation and poor sensitivty. iOS even though with less config products can make﻿ better games and app, make them run far better with less errors and more stable. What will you do with a quad core﻿ if you done have the right apps for it, so still, iPad 2> Any other tablet.
Icecream sandwitch will make this whole lot better but for now honycomb is great.(i typed this from the transformer) I also﻿ got minecraft to work
you're﻿ not alone. I thought the previous model had a better looking backing too but maybe this model will look better in person.
so sick of people upping the ipad and ipad 2, YES it WAS a good piece of hardware, but until the ipad 3 comes out, its totally out of date. the ONLY things going for the ipad are the MASSIVE app store who's growth is slowing with the rise in popularity of android and soon to take another blow from windows 8 and the image of apple. dont believe me? try running﻿ a proper bench mark test of the asus transformer prime vs the ipad 2.
nah im going for the asus, apple﻿ is a bit conservative with their products like they havent changed much of the design. buying mine this week.
@hfcsoccer422 you do know that the ipad is basically just an oversized phone. its video quality goes as far as 720p the camera is about 1mp (the same as the ipod touch) and theres no flash player. the android tablets has got the ipad beat. unfortunately people will still pay for﻿ apple products just cause of the logo. do ur research before calling the ipad "better"
I heard ics on this gives better experience than a pc.﻿ I want it but asus is working on a $250 tablet
I own both pads, the asus now comes with Ice Cream﻿ Sandwich, absolutely blows the IPad away. The Hardware is superior, sd card slot is just an added bonus. The problem with the Verge when they review anything is they are just Apple sucks. As I said I own both pads and by FAR the Asus is just superior in all departments and now that the ASus is shipped with Ice Cream Sandwich this pad is a monster, smooth as a babies bottom and real slick. Try one out and you will not believe it.
Got one last night﻿ after watching god knows how many reviews. I honestly can't put it down. Upgraded to ics right out of the box. Awesome.......
Nook > Kobo Vox > Amazon Fire﻿
This two devices (Nook and Fire) show how much overpriced is the Galaxy﻿ Tab 7.0 plus
This seems a lot faster than﻿ the Kindle to me. What do you think, Lisa?
I had a Sylvania Tablet to get familiar with having a Tablet & my BIGGEST complaint was the battery life. I like the 7" because it is to type on the screen while holding it with 2 hands. What I am liking up front with this﻿ is the battery life. It is on my list of interest. Thanks for the review!!!
I would﻿ choose this over the fire. This is much better.
Awesome review as always even when I don't like the﻿ product. This is a good product though.
I love Jane Lynch, I'll take a Nook﻿ tab and Jane!
Wow. This makes the Kindle Fire﻿ look like a fucking POS. I am definitely going to purchase a Nook Tablet.
The Nook﻿ Tablet seems like a more compelling package than the Kindle Fire. I hate that amazon ASSUMES that you're going to always be connected to wifi and they don't offer a sd card slot
ikr? way better specs and much faster﻿
Twice the RAM and a faster processor definitely improves the PDF reader. I don't understand why only 1 GB is for your own content. What B&N content is there that will take up 13-15 GB? I have 5 GB of PDF files, and movies I ripped from my DVDs. Ya, it has a micro SD card slot, but that is no excuse. This is﻿ still better than the Kindle Fire.
Watching this from my rooted CM7 nook color which has been so good to me but I can't wait to sell this﻿ to a gamer and buy me the tablet cause once the folks finish the CM9 ( android 4.0) ROM ill be in cloud nine :-)
This looks great, definitely picking this one over the fire, great﻿ review.
Read and record kid books? That looks really awesome for﻿ parents!
Nook color 2﻿ wins.
You can add up to 32gigs of﻿ memory from a micro ad slot which the Kfire does not have, so the 1GB argument is absurd
Lisa, another Nook tablet user reports Veetle.com worked for him but much better with the opera mobile browser﻿ on his nook tablet
@uglyfonts, Amazon prime is Free for 1 month ONLY, then it's $79.99 if you want to keep all the streaming videos/buying media/Lending Library etc. No﻿ such expensive cost to the NT.
magazine pages﻿ actually turn now! best feature yet!
ENGADGET Nook has an edge here, with its 1GB of RAM to the﻿ Fire's 512MB -- and certainly the difference is noticeable, even when booting up something as simple as a game like Angry Birds. Things are even more pronounced during video playback. We took Shutter Island for a spin via Netflix streaming on both devices, and it was really like night and day. Motion is far less choppy on the Barnes & Noble device. ﻿
GOOD NEWS!!! NOOK TABLET HAS﻿ BEEN ROOTED!! With the Market!!! Check the XDA FORUMS
Lisa, thanks to you I﻿ got my Nook Tablet a few hours ago! Love it!
For watching movies, Kindle﻿ Fire. For everything else, Nook Tablet.
amazing!!!!!! so buying﻿ this! I have the Kindle Fire and definitely prefer the Nook Tablet. (xxAlecPurexx)
Kindle﻿ has a huge glare
I just purchased this little guy, very impressed, love﻿ this thing.
Never tried the Fire but I just picked this up and I love﻿ the thing, its pretty awesome.
You don't like landscape view for some reason. It's great﻿ for videos. What kind of games can you chose from??
Seems like nook is better then the fire but. Fire is marketed more so I wouldn't be surprised if the﻿ fire sells more
way better than﻿ a ipad im geting one!
im very conflicted i cant decide whether to get this of the kindle fire the kindle is a hundred dallers less but i am﻿ in love with nooks i had the original i can't decide
lol, but its cheap﻿ and fast although doesn't have camera but I think its still worth it. Maybe it can upgraded to ice cream sandwich next year
I was considering the Kindle Fire but then my friend told me to get the Nook, and I just did some research - probably going with the nook. The $50 USD is worth it in my﻿ opinion.
The Nook Tablet is MUCH better. I was watching comparison videos &﻿ yeah by far the Nook.
What makes a lot of people prefer the Kindle fire over the nook tablet is the fact that the Kindle has way more apps﻿ than the nook. But what people don't know is that you can EASILY sideload the Amazon app store onto your nook tablet. So in my opinion I would go with the nook tablet.
I'm so happy that I'm getting this for Christmas!﻿ This is actually going to be the awesomest thing that my parents ever bought that's technology casue their so "old school"
The Nook﻿ Tablet is better.
Get the NOOK﻿ Tablet, much better.
Get the NOOK Tablet, much﻿ better.
In speed and memory, the nook beats kindle fire. But there is one huge problem. Although it says that there are 16 gb of storage, 1 gb is accesible to user. 13 gb is used for B&N stuff (upgrades, book. etc). Although, the nook color has a micro sd card so u can add more memory. If﻿ u can live with only 1 gb of apps, then yea.
Just got one for my wife. It's great. It has built in wi-fi and﻿ it has netflix. That does it for me. And yes.....you can also go on facebook. lol
I am now officially obsessed with your reviews. You are hands down bar none the best reviewer I have ever found on youtube! You are thorough, clear, and you give the information that is important without making me want to fast forward. I wish I could read your reviews﻿ on EVERYTHING even beyond just tech because I am soooo impressed.
I got this for Christmas ... I love it. My only complaint ... thought the volume would be louder. ﻿ I don't even detect audio until about the 5th bar.
Got one﻿ from my father for Christmas and I LOVE IT!
got one for christmas and﻿ its awesome!!! im writing this comment on it right now!:D
@Langosta83 the nook tablet is the best for reading and everything else.... The simple touch is only in black and white and I dont think that it can read color mags.... Hope I helped! :3﻿
Nook Tablet!! lol﻿
@wwwuraretard The reason the nook tablet is more expensive is because it's much faster and has 2x﻿ the amount of RAM.
@wwwuraretard or just get Netflix﻿ for 8 bucks a month, I got the tablet for my e text books, so convenient and fun, netflix between classes XD
I put﻿ a 32gb sd card in mine love it
I﻿ am a kindle fan but I love the nooks UI
The Nook has volume controls ie: not software based. It accepts microSD up to 32 gigs. I have heard the battery life is better. It is dual core (I do not know if the Fire is dual core) the Fire works better for﻿ people who are Amazon Prime members (I heard) which costs $70+ per year. If I could afford it, I'd have a Nook Tablet right now. I'm drooling over it. My friend has a Nook tablet and it's beautiful/awesome.
is it ironic that i'm watching this video on my kindle fire? lol. after watching this, i think i'm going﻿ to return my fire for the nook tablet. does anyone think its worth it?
yes, i love my nook color .also nook has﻿ 2.5 million books,kindle is 1 million
Yep, it's faster, sd card slot for more space (up to 32 GB sd﻿ card) but in apps it doesn't have so much but their working on getting more(some of the apps are kind've overpriced). Nice speakers. Browser's not that fast but they have puffin & dolphin browser HD. they removed root and sideload but you can still do it just need a sd card.
Kindle fire is some dog $hit man 200$ worth of nothing nook all the﻿ way
Hi So this device has the TI OMAP4 which is slightly quicker﻿ than Tegra 2.So the processesing power is same as Ipad2 plus it has more memory.
There is a free app called "Skitch" for drawing - it is not﻿ "serious" though, more for fun. Also, I was able to send the drawing to my husband via the email app on the nook. Needless to say, I'm blown away by how awesome this device is...
I've been using my Nook 16gb Tab for a few weeks now - I love it! Fantastic device!﻿
games look awesome on this :0 hint﻿ (rooted nook)
Flashed cyanogenmod it is awesome﻿
even so, some people like the nook better﻿ than an ipad. I just think the nook is classier looking.
You can do a lot more with Nook than Kindle.﻿
well the library﻿ that it has holds up to 2.5 million books so i should have the book u want.
yes but it can also do alot more like playing apps or﻿ searching the web etc.
Yeah but if you dont have a lot of money to buy apple, this is good﻿ for now (:
Really?? U only basically﻿ have 1 frickin gigabyte why can't u have 16!!! Then it would defiantly be so much better than the kindle!!!!
Yeah, my cousin has a Kindle Fire, and I like﻿ my Nook better, but it comes to personal opinion. Getting a Nook HD.
i just got my Nook Tablet and i know that﻿ after seeing this video I am going to love it better then my Kiddle frie that i sold to my daugther thank you for doing this vido
Just﻿ got mine today so far I looove it
This looks pretty awesome, maybe a secondary phone﻿ for my iPhone?
This is the best thing on Earth planet. Well, I want some improvements. Six thousands M A h, five hundreds﻿ gigabytes SSD harddrive, twelve Mpx photocamera with CONTINUOUSLY AUTOFIXZOOM ON TEXT PAGE FIT HIGH SPEED SCAN.
Nice...I'm waiting for the Galaxy SIII﻿ though...
Does anybody know if this﻿ phone has a chance of coming to Verizon? I really like this phone. And if not, which phone on Verizon compares most to the Galaxy Note or S II?
get bigger hands. i have this phone and i use one hand only very easy when you have man hands. its super light. games look﻿ crazy good on this phone.
Not gonna lie the "phone" looks good and all but that's exactly it, I want a phone not a tv.. 4.3 inches is good﻿ enough for me
It looks good, I like big screens but 5.3 is too big for a﻿ phone o.O but to each their own, some love it some don't.. thats life
the size is﻿ perfect !!!
Note + ICS + No buttons =﻿ Win!
i honestly think this﻿ is awesome! ... a friend of mine bought it .. and the screen is just amazing.. good for people like me who browse and watch videos a lot !
I use that ics keyboard too!! Its really and free!!﻿
great for﻿ watching porn
P.s. any chance to win this beautiful phone? ;)﻿
5.3 inches is the perfect size ;) she'll love﻿ it
beautiful phone﻿
Best-spec'ed phone on the market, as far as﻿ I am concerned. The only turn-off is the gigantic size. 4.7" is as large as my hands will reasonably go.
Two things.﻿ Tablone. Bring on a 6 in phone. Better have that HD display though
OMG!!!! I CAN NOT WAIT TO GET THIS PHONE AND I'M GETTING THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION I MUST HAVE THAT EXYNOS AND THAT﻿ BUTTON LOOKS NICE AS WELL
I love this phone, however I am not﻿ sure how portable this would be in everyday life.
I have huge fuckin hands... so this would be amazing for me. Also, I was going to buy a new phone and a tablet, but now I﻿ can get both in one device... woohoo
HUGE GIGANTIC TABLET!﻿ COOL
just﻿ got my galaxy note love it!!!!!!!!!!
I got my galaxy note and i love it isss hugeeee but i﻿ juste to good
This phone looks AWESOME.﻿
What's great about this phone is that if you're on the go, and you want enough screen real estate for browsing, without the SECOND CARRIER CONTRACT that would come along with a 4G tablet, this is the way forward. I have a WIFI-only Samsung Tablet for home and work, where there's wifi availability, but this will be perfect for everywhere else without the need for a﻿ second contract.
Once you go note you don't go back.﻿
I have the Note and its the perfect size. The iphone is﻿ a dinky toy compared to the Note.
the i phone﻿ is for ants, but galaxy note is for people.. haha
Galaxy﻿ SII and galaxy note rocks !!!!!
Its a great driving companion (navigation), camera, and personal device. I find myself using my computer less and simply plugging this bad boy in for all my browsing needs. Its pocketable and works fine for anyone who uses both hands﻿ when using their phone. Its a great medium so I'll be selling my old phone, tablet, gps and dated point/shoot camera.
This phone﻿ would be awesome with Draw Something :D
I﻿ Love This Phone ❤___❤
I fell in love with this phone. Gonna get one in two﻿ weaks
Seems useful. My aunt let me play with hers﻿
sOoOo aweSome like i will get it 2 day (^_*)﻿
:D:D yeS yeasterday yeasterday really and﻿ i got it really so﻿ cute but so big but i love it and the cOlour is black.
go for﻿ the note, its awesome!! you'll get use to the size.
I like the Iphone, but I want the scren size. I will have to deal with android for it, but I like the idea of having a big﻿ screen.
get the s3 or note﻿ i phone is dieing
iPhone = Cheap shit that's over priced!﻿ Galaxy Note = iPhone killer
Must say, I really﻿ like this. We need it on Sprint!
Greatest phone I've ever bought﻿ in my life!
i'm﻿ gonna get that phone this week yipee!!! u suck!! iphone!!
im 6 feet 6 inch tall and almost every phone is like a pebble in my hands. finally a big phone for us big guys. this﻿ phone fits perfectly in palm of my hands. im gonna get this badboy and show off with it. yeah!!!
iPhone = I need a microscope﻿ to see it. Galaxy Note = THE BAWES!!!!!!!
I recomment note ll if you like big screen. This one is obsolete now.﻿ The S III is good also and perfect if you dont want to wait
@techxtreem The thing is its going to be on an upgrade, and I really need a new phone and I want this one like I say for art and to run a few pages on Facebook﻿ and for texting and calling friends and shit, and this phone looks amazing and I was wondering can it fit in my pocket? Because ill be taking it to school.
LOL , Iphone looks like a little boy , kids toy next to this﻿ beast. I need one of these. When will apple learn they need more phone size options tsk tsk....
i own a iphone 4s for the first time, BIG MISTAKE> i owned before only android devices, and now i﻿ regret swithching to ios...next buy , galaxy note/note2
BEFORE Iphone= Im the best phone ever AFTER GALAXY﻿ NOTE COMES OUT Iphone = "SUICIDE"
GALAXY﻿ NOTE FTW!!!
I NEED this phone! It looks so amazing.﻿
It looks like a very promising product. Good luck Amazon! (btw, I own the original iPad and I'm very happy to see new products)﻿
Awesome review﻿
My﻿ little sister is going to love this :). It'll be there in two or three days.
but you get more for your money. and how does the os blow? ive used it﻿ before and its not that bad. its just a customized version of gingerbread
i personally like the kindle fire a lot... so i would go with that one... of course the kindle keyboard has less features but doesn't give you eye﻿ starin and finally price... nook color is 250 kindle fire is 200 and kindle keybaord 99/139 so its up to you, i think the kindle fire is best with its good features and its good price.
Amazing intro! Where can I get the theme song? Haha! Nice review, as usual.﻿ The Fire sure beats the Nook and its 1GB of non-B&N internal storage! (Thank God it's got external storage!) Exclamation point!!!!
Damn amazon not having the fire available in the UK. It﻿ looks really really good too :(
Good review..Nice piece of kit for the price. Wonder when﻿ we'll get it in the uk? Should set the cat amongst the pigeons with that low price point. About time too! Great alternative if you can't afford that iPad..
it shouldn't be scratched since its made of gorilla glass which is a really strong substabnce.. so it doesn't necesarilly need a cover to prevent a scracth﻿
If you are fine getting content from Amazon, the Kindle Fire should be a nice step up. But if you like 3D games, the selection﻿ is much smaller on Android vs. iOS.
It takes 4 hours to charge. The battery goes like this: with non-stop reading/the kindle just being turned on, it last 8 hours. But for video﻿ watching and browsing the internet, it last for 7.5 hours. The battery is pretty good.
I like the﻿ look of this. I wonder when, if ever, the United Kingdom will get it ?
I love my new kindle fire!! It's amazing and for﻿ a cheap price too :D
i love my kindle fire, but finding a wifi area is annoying. is there a device you could recommend for me to use﻿ to access it whenever, wherever?
So glad my parent﻿ got me this for Christmas, it seems really cool, especially as it will be my first tablet. :D
I got this the day it came out and loved it, to everyone else though...don't buy this thing and expect ipad performance. Its a great tablet and the amazon content is amazing but you will see the difference between $200 and $500. I would still advise you get this tablet overall﻿ though
Amazon is usually good with international services, but I'd check with their Kindle site and see if you can enjoy﻿ the services in Thailand. Email them if you can't find info. They are pretty good at support. Good luck!
My wife and I have had Amazon Prime for a while and do alot of ahopping on amazon on our﻿ iPhone's so I bought her one for Christmas, thank you for the review, it has kept me from unwrapping her new fire so I could play with it. I'm glad you showed the Prime features for the device because we have only used Prime for the shipping benifits and really had no idea about all the stuff we can get with via Prime
cant spell ignorant without ign.... it﻿ isnt slow at all i got mine and it does everything i want and more its very fast dual core processor and silk browser makes it FAST AS HELL get one youll love it
Good review! I went to Best Buy today to take﻿ a look at two tablets. Looked at the Kindle Fire while I waited for some folks to finish w/the Asus Transformer. Even though I knew about the Kindle Fire's release and am an avid Amazon shopper I never took the time to review it. It is a pretty neat gadget. It's just right if you don't want too much hype or all the bells and whistles. I'm a bit of a gadget hound; I'll likely end up with a tablet but the Kindle Fire is the perfect economical choice.
That thing runs minecraft better than﻿ my laptop...
Got this for my mom. I think it is perfect shes the﻿ kind of person that doesnt need all the extra stuff on the iPad she has an ipod touch but doesnt use it. I got this for her so she can read books because thats what she wants to do for the most part. I think it is perfect.Thanks
For me this has broken all the rules of what a kindle is for ﻿ Its good but not for me
i﻿ just got mine today nd i love it
Its nice however if﻿ you cant go on the net or get unlimited stuff on android You are not really getting unlimited! Like it says"
I recently got the Kindle﻿ Fire. In my opinion it's a The best tablet out there. As I was looking at the store there most of them are all free APPS. IT HAS FAST BROWSER SEARCHING. REALLY EASY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE. Free texting and all that. I hope these answered some of your questions :)
Yes﻿ u can. It works pretty good!!
yes although I'm not sure about the flash games but its Internet browser is fairly nice, as﻿ a matter of fact I'm using one right now.
i'd not only prefer kindle fire over nook color because its an opinion but because it's not just a tablet , its more than that not only 4 its price but 4 its capability it does a lot more than other tablets would , though both nook color and kindle fire are e-readers you'd be surprised on how many people would prefer a kindle fire over a nook color , though this may be an opinion with supporting facts , getting a kindle fire over a nook would be a﻿ choice you'd never regret.
i'd prefer a kindle fire over a nook color not only for its capability but for how it amazes you though it's true that both products are e-readers but it feels different a kindle fire is not just a﻿ tablet it is more than that, with a kindle fire it nearly feels like you're holding a tablet but something treasured , you'd be surprised on how much people prefer a kindle fire over a nook color , its just how its build and how it works,, trust me , you wont regret choosing a K-F
@orlandoichigo yes you can upload music from ur kindle fire. i got it for christmas and it is very handy. There is free mjsic and music you can buy so its your choice.﻿ i dont know about the computer but if you look it up i garenteed you will find something:)
Just want to let everyone know that Maxthon browser is available on the kindle fire via amazon appstore. This browser will make your browsing experience much more enjoyable because as we all know the silk browser sucks, I love my kindle fire but its the truth. For those that are tired off the sluggish silk go to the appstore and get it. I'm not linked to them in﻿ anyway just a happy customer!
The best﻿ review on youtube as usual!!!! just got my kindle fire today took a little work since everyones out of stock. But im glad i worked to get it i love it !!!
They don't have that currently unfortunately. Amazon has a large collection of books including titles for young adults, but they﻿ don't have the nifty interactive books for kids found on the Nook.
I like the review of the kindle Fire and I LOVE Amazon﻿ and will soon be checking out Prime. That being said, I think I'm going to wait for the Kindle Fire 2.
hehe im watching this on my kindpe fire. i love my﻿ Fire but the only problem i have with it is the keyboard. just typing this comment took a while cause i was constantly unintentionally typing wrong letters
im very amazed about this Kindle Fire. i really would love to have one as i am getting﻿ more into reading i would love to have this on the go. good Review,
You can also go to amazon on your PC and upload any music files you may have purchased from Itunes and other sources and upload them to the amazon cloud through your laptop or desktop and they will show﻿ up in the could for you to download to your kindle. This really is a great product for the price point
From a technical aspect the Nook is "better" due to things like more RAM (1GB﻿ compared to the Fire's 512MB) but personally I feel everything sort of synergizes and flows together better on the Fire than on the Nook.
Yes, I purchased one last week and it's awesome. I had a nook but sent it back, the kindle fire﻿ is awesome. Test both out in stores and you'll enjoy. It was ready to go out the box. The nook only gave me free 1 issue trials on magazines. They barely had free books, kindle fire is awesome!!!
Great review and Iisa's right. This is a high quality e-reader/tablet. I have an Ipad & Motorola xoom and the kindle fire is amazing!!!! I purchased the nook but found it kind of outdated. This is touchscreen and you can do alot if with it. Supports flash, can download any book from the amazon market, the app store is cool, has tons of storage and free online cloud. I've﻿ downloaded music & videos and play em in my car while driving. This kindle fire rocks!!!!
I love that is called the kindle﻿ fire. You know like it's meant to burn books.
ITS AT WALMART TOO! im gettin one tomorrow and its awesome i tried﻿ it at walmart and it is the only reason im getting it. otherwise i woulda dismissed it as an iPad knockoff but its a completely unique device
The kindle fire is great for apps movies and music and web browsing but if you want to use﻿ your kindle more for reading, the kindle fire may hurt your eyes because of the LCD backlight. So if you wanna get a kindle to read on I suggest the other kindles so they won't hurt your eyes
I think I will get one. I was going to go﻿ with the iPad, but this is more affordable, and I feel like an iPad would be useless, to someone who has an iPhone. Hey maybe it will get me reading as well.
@ thunder aj Get the kindle fire I have the nook& there games suck they Even charge you for angry birds 2.99 infact.. also kindle comes pre load with more free apps.. like face book.. hulu plus.. my friend has one & trust me kindle fire is much better.. eBay has them for under a﻿ 200$..
@ thunder aj "Ya welcome &﻿ you won't be sorry getting the kindle fire I'm .. gonna get one this week MYSELF: )..
I love my﻿ fire :))
Cool technology.. Shame﻿ about the weirdly massive hands :S ....freaky
Doest lack apps﻿ at all, Quicker than most tablets, Shipped with an email client, Guess the ipad is no match for this.
There SOOO﻿ cheap now omg!
Your review of the Acer Iconia A500 was very well done & it's helped me greatly in deciding on this particular tablet. It's March 2012, & right now here in the U.S. the Iconia A500's are﻿ going for about $250 to$300. I've researched info on this product & after watching your video, I think this is the one 4 me :)
good tablet,﻿ good review.
Really﻿ good I want one are they better then the iPad 3
Android doesn't need﻿ that much memory so 512MB is plenty for surfing internet, playing apps, working on office files etc.
Good driving skills... :)﻿
I felt Lenovo's Gallery was quite cool.. ﻿
i just got this tablet @ Office Depot for $280 and at﻿ that price it was a no brainer. its a good tab, not the best but for 32gb for 280 i had to
Both BEST BUY and OFFICE﻿ DEPOT have this on sale this week for $349.99 which seems like a sweet price for this tablet. I might have to get one myself!
So I am considering getting a tablet for christmas.. and this is a well priced one, but I'm wondering how gameplay on it is, such as GTA 3,﻿ or other 3d games.
I'm buying this on sale for $299 -- I've always had Lenovo laptops, and I need something durable, so Lenovo it is.﻿ Besides, a $32GB tablet for $299 is amazing.
Would be able to remove all the Lenovo pre-installed﻿ apps. I love this tablet... but I hate the lenovo apps.
Ice Cream Sandwich makes this tablet much faster and more stable. if you update﻿ use the rooted version so google play works.
from cheap categories i thin lenovo﻿ ideapad a1 is the best
this thing has the same build quality as the $500﻿ galaxy tab 10.1
hey I have this tablet and is not this crap why that﻿ people do this
The only﻿ thing that is nice about this tab is you have vanilla android 2.3 . Works fine . Not sure this will be updated to stock ics which is even better than stock 2.3
almost everything thing he said is a not true i have the﻿ tablet it great it has a nice feel the screen is bright and great and so are the viewing angles. It easy to touch and browsing is good but if you download opera browser from 1moble markets it very fast and it does have youtube it a great tablet coulnt ask for more
Not a fair review. I own it and it is a pretty good piece of hardware which you can now get it for <100€ in Europe. You should have a look at﻿ the more accurate review by thetecherra (search on youtube) It's an excellent choice if you need a low cost tablet for a child for example.
i have this one,i think it`s good, i have watched youtube and netflix plus hd movies seems fine to me,maybe some poeple will love it some will hate it.i﻿ have htc wildfire android phone i like it more than an iphone.i paid 200pound for the tablet which i think is over priced.
First to post, last in life. Great review Lisa, though if I﻿ had to pick an Android tablet, it would be the ASUS Transformer.
Build quality is always an issue with Acer. I have one of their﻿ laptops and its worked well fo me for almost 4 years. But from day one liiiiitle things have not been as tight as you would like. I'm serious to see what the Asus tablet is like.
Looks Great. ﻿
Really, it comes down to android vs iOS. If you want more functionality﻿ and customization, this tablet is better. If you want a great battery life and a really easy to use tablet, the ipad is the way you want to go. I personally prefer android, because you can customize your pages with widgets and I prefer a more computer like experience.
Lisa, Lisa Lisa, good review not grate. You missed a few things, you never talked about the speakers on the back & the Iconia produce the best sound out of all the tablets that are out. with Dolby surround it is by fay better than the rest. Also you didn't mention the secondary keyboard with haptic feedback. There is a little symbol﻿ at the bottom right of the keyboard that lets you access that option. I will never go back to using the honeycomb keyboard. & my software says a500 & not a501 ;-)
you are right, I've owned the acer Ferrari branded notebook for a﻿ while now and it works pretty well. I have the Iconia and I don't see any cracks in the aluminum like what Lisa said in her review. The viewing angles is pretty good, the sound is damn good for a tablet, I only wish it had the Movie Studio like the Motorola Xoom. Oh, and it's much smoother than the Xoom.
lol actually really considering﻿ selling my ipad2 for this tablet
I just purchased mine today @ Best Buy.﻿ I love it
rotation lock switch, all tablets﻿ should have that
im between this and the xoom. i really like the body design of the xoom and im happy with moto products. i have a droid right now and i LOVE it. (rooted running cm7). the only things keeping me form the xoom is. will the a500 be rooted and supported by cm? (locked bootloader?) . and. THIS HAS USB HOST that is a huge selling point for me. and the fact that it cant handle the video playback is.. well. upsetting. but that should be fixed with and update. i bet﻿ its a driver issue or something
The difference﻿ is 70 dollar, and it's funny how this tablet pretty much owns the xoom, difference is purely nothing. So stop being a lame little bitch mr " My dad my tablet cause i can't afford one myself"
you must be the dumbass the bought this pos tablet because you couldn't afford the Xoom! How does it own the Xoom idiot? Is it the choppy video playback or cheap build quality? Beat it you cheap bastard!﻿
watching big bang love song! BigBang just the bests!! (fan moment) this tab seems to be pretty smooth isn't it? but i﻿ think tha asus did a better job on eee pad transformer, don't you think?
it's fine... i﻿ have one and the videos look great
it doesn't really feel﻿ heavy... it feels sturdy
Just picked up one of these and it is pretty darn nice. Love the screen and there are plenty of free apps to entertain the kids. Also, it played back every movie that I﻿ ripped to it. Fun little talblet. Cool GPS feature too.
A cool tablet, but Acer has a small laptop that is about as small as a tablet, so what is the﻿ advantage of a tablet over a small laptop?? The camera is one thing, but the little laptops are more affordable. Could you compare the Iconia to Acers little laptop?? How do you keep the tablet screen from getting a bunch of finger smears??
personnaly i don't like windows on a netbook, i do love android though, battery life is way better on a tablet, personally i'd go for a tablet, but i really don't like netbooks, or normal laptops for that matter﻿
Now just carry what you need, no need to bring﻿ the kitchen sink. OK this seems to be versatile and should allow you to leave the sink home:)
@InsaneTux: Great review and I just saw this tablet at a mall here in Bangkok. It was playing the aquarium screensaver and it was fast/beautiful. Last night I read some more reviews and there were almost 150 of them. Came out 89% positive. What I saw was a really nice tablet with finally some usb connectivity. Great speed and if you opt for the 32 gig with another 32 gig sd card, then﻿ that is very nice.
going to be fixed at upgrade. I saw no﻿ one that owned one complaining about this!
720 is ok for me,﻿ I have a Samsung tab I can use if I want!
Good connectivity features on it. The Xoom feels like﻿ a brick when picked up compared to this.
i fell in﻿ love with honeycomb in bestbuy while using this tablet. this tablet feels good on the hands and smooth touch screen.
@onlyrunonsupreme i suggest you go to bestbuy and try both out. although i used both for just a few mins. i loved the acer A500. the ipad has the big advantage of having so many apps, but honeycomb is much smoother than it looks in this vid. this tablet also﻿ feels just as solid and well built as the ipad. android will expand the app market, obviously. it is a hard choice. but also compare the prices. this tablet has a great price tag.
OMG i can't believe u played that big bang video!! haha﻿ ur awesome. n i came here after seeing the 4.5/5 rating on futureshop which i was really surprised about. it does seem like a good deal for what u pay...one question, if anyone can answer...does the tablet get really hot if u use it for too long?
i think i will buy﻿ it. not ipad.
Im tempted to buy this instead of﻿ the Galaxy 10.1 bcuz of SD card support
advantages of an ipad 1) it is slimmer 2) it has better graphics3) it has cool apps 4) its more famous BUT ITS DISADVANTAGE IS ITS EXPENSIVE DUE TO WHICH IT MAKES US MAKE﻿ A 2 YEAR LONG DECISION WETHER WE SHOULD GET IT OR NOT
honestly, this tablet is by far the most appealing one out all, due to the fact that it has a usb slot. Also if you guys are thinking about this tablet and﻿ the asus, go with this one, because the video recording quality is a whole lot better.
the iconia is nicer ﻿
I JUST got this one for $280 bucks+ free shipping+no applicable taxes. I﻿ was aiming for the asus transformer(for the screen resolution mainly and IPS), but I got the chance to get this one instead for the price tag only.. Is it a good buy??
great buy!! i﻿ bought it las week and i love it.
ok I just got this Tablet. Im ok﻿ with this tablet, But also I own a Apple Ipad 2nd gen. Nothing to compare with Apple. but I like this one also, AND I saw that is compatible with Microsoft Work, which Apple doesn't, but I just have 1 quest. Can I print out documents?? I tried but i couldn't, can this be performed???
i just got this about a month ago. i got a 32 gb wityh﻿ the $40 acer case. GREAT PURCHASE! now the thing is the price evrywhere is about 399. now the 32 would be 499 + that 40 dollar case. your at about 540 without tax. where i got it (Costco i think) had it for 430 with 32gb built in storage and the case! huge savings. if your looking for an advanced 10.1 inch tab that is full featured get this.
thanks to your review i ended up buying this﻿ tablet. i like it so far. im impressed very solid smooth piece of tech.
a500 is better its cheaper , lighter , thinner and has USB port . Only advantage of XOOM is that it gets O.S updates earlier then any other tablet﻿ .
I like this tablet when i got it for the﻿ first day, but then I was just playing a game on it, it was running well then the screen started screwing up, and then the screen turned white, I tried reseting it and turnining it off/on, didn't work, so im guessing i will have to return it.
Hi! I really like this﻿ tablet and i want one for Christmas, but the only place that has it is the 8gb version, which i dont really care about because my main point is using the internet on it. Do you think i should still buy it?? Thanks :)
thanks very much :) btw i got it like 3 days ago and it was last in the store and i got it :) its a realy good android tab :)﻿
Congrats!! Glad﻿ to hear you like it!!
seriously considering getting a tablet and this one﻿ seems to be the best from my research... Any thoughts??
@koutsou805 Just got it refurb'd for $260.﻿ and i didn't even have to wait outside a store all night like a moron
Looks like a﻿ small TV I like it.
I was caught in that situation. I think the Xoom is better all around but I got the Acer Iconia from Best Buy for $229 + $10 gift card on their cyber monday sale. They aren't that much different and I couldn't find justification for paying﻿ $150 more for the Xoom.
We﻿ had no problem with video playback in the browser.
Guess what, I'm not sure if you noticed, but your iPad 2 also costs AT THE VERY LEAST twice the price. This is for people who cannot afford to spend as much as a laptop costs on a gigantic ipod touch with 3g. I'd love you to try and run flash AT ALL on your iPad. Oh yea, you can't, and probably never will. Nobody is trying to compare this tablet or any other in its range to the iPad 2,﻿ the iPad's price puts itself in a whole other level of devices.
Her comments ok but not perfect. She is soo pessimistic. I ordered A500 yesterday﻿ and I will get in a few days anyway... With this price, these things fair enough. She critisized HD. Who watches Hd from tablet. It is not soo important thing. General, A500 is the best for now,
She is ok but soo pessimistic. I was thinking to buy samsung but after I saw A500, definetly A500. most of all you have USB and HDMI out. Thats﻿ enough. You can use externall HD also. And screen better then motorola. Same like samsung. And price is the best! People comments on camera or HD play. Picture should taken with a camera and HD should watch in a HD tv...Please guys, you should look at this amazing tablett in you hands. I suggest for everyone!
This is soooo DOPE ! Thinking about getting it for my﻿ birthday .
@Timothy17Fan she did not want to pill the case off? Your nothing but a Apple fanboy. What's so great﻿ about that over grown ipod anyways? This is more powerful,unique,cheaper and is open to all app offers.
This does have gps, i have it, great tablet only thing that they can say is that's it's a little heavy, unless your a pusy it won't affect u, the iPad is another way for apple to﻿ sell you something like a oversized iPod, look st the iPhone 4"s" wdf apple!!!!
after this video by Lisa (?) I went out on black Friday and got the last one at Staples for $300.00...wow it's great...got the micro card at Walgreen (2﻿ GB) $13.99 ...everything works great...got screen cover and case for Christmas...you're fantastic Lisa !!!
Ok so I want to buy a tablet like this. but I want it to write my book and since this one has a usb port for flash drives it has a big advantage. BUT I want to know if the touchscreen keyboard is comfortable for my needs, beacues i don't want to buy a usb or bluetooth keyboard since that's not very portable and portable is what I need. so bottomo line: touchscreen keyboard﻿ good for heavy writing or not? please answer!
i﻿ just bought mines on ebay, great deal i got thank GOD! thanks for the review!
Nice price!!! Please let us﻿ know how you like it! :)
everyone if you want this cheap go to best buy they let it for about $295 very cheap and﻿ near you get it rite there dnt wait for it online get it today!!!
Its awesome! I have the 32 gig and with a 16 gig sd card I downloaded every app I wanted and more! plus have more than 5 movies on it. The HDMI out works great It supports ps3 controller! (if a game supports a controller it﻿ works) Keyboard (and even mouse if you want) Great tablet and excellent price!
Netflix﻿ has worked for me just fine
Had mine for awhile, love﻿ it. expand to 32 with an SD and a 32 on thumb drive. taken videos and pictures. Can't beat it,take it everywhere. Like it much better then the IPad
got mine for only $204﻿ new. I LOVE EBAY
I got mine 165$﻿ love google
I'm very impressed with your review. I liked how you put it together. I'm wondering if you are going to review the Asus Tf300. I'm torn between the two.﻿ Both have issues.
Just bought a used one today for 250$... Seems like a pretty﻿ good product. But weird thing is that the tab cannot connect to my d-link router... Will have to buy a better more recent one...
I﻿ am watching this on an Acer tablet and I love it. sound is GREAT.
Well﻿ found it on Ebid for 189 total how cool I live a good deal!!!
Ordering mine tomorrow. I don't see what the fuss is about the A200. Seems like a cheaper tablet with the same specs, dimmer screen, and a "better" UI. I think the A500 looks better﻿ as well. But better or worse, I prefer the brighter screen. Hope I am making the right choice.
Is it worth $220 (refurbished). It's getting a little out of date but I want it for﻿ taking notes for highschool.
i like it﻿ soooooo.....soon i'll buy one :)
This tablet is faster, larger, and has more features than a kindle fire. I bought one refurbished off amazon and it was even cheaper than a kindle fire. Great buy for a decent tablet. We returned our vizio vtab to get this one. The camera is decent, 2mp front, 5mp back. Doesn't compare to my logitech﻿ pro 9000 desktop webcam, but is all right for casual use. Microphone works nicely. This tablet also has support in the rooting community.
Thanks for your answer. This was the kind of review I was hoping to see. I have been thinking about getting a tablet for a while but as we all know the ipad is too overpriced for a guy like me who has bills and who is currently a college student. So i needed to go for something that works﻿ but for a lesser price and this seemed to do it. I have seen so many $60-100 tablets out there all with terrible reviews and well this review you posted is enough for me to say I would buy one. Thanks :)
How﻿ does the webcam on this one compare with the A700? I know the screen resolution is lower on this one but its also cheaper.
I LOVE my Acer Iconia 501. I have 32GB and it is 3G. The Sim card works just fine. I also love how I can plug my USB stuff from my PC into it. Love it and would never go Apple -﻿ they hold you ransom with the no plugging anything in. BLAH!
Note on that video performance. Don't know what their problem is. I've got the Iconia A500 and play high res video on it all the time. Don't think I've ever had much of a stutter. Nothing ever like what the video showed. One of the things that sold me on the Acer was the responsiveness that none﻿ of the others seemed to have. Always smooth for me.
Ipad sucks just﻿ like apple fan boys fact u have no control with ipad but with android u have 100% control
I've been saving up for a tablet with a large screen that I can draw / paint on﻿ (with a stylus) , but I don't want to have an iPad. my budget is about $300 and I found a refurbished one f these at walmart for $230. I think I will be satisfied.
love﻿ this tablet
