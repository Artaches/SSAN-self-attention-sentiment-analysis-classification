the screen is yellowishhhhhhhhhhhhhh﻿
Apple dont have a big﻿ market place.. I'm tired android
The﻿ iPad 2's battery lasts longer, and is supposedly a bit more faster. The new iPad has Retina Display, as in a lot of pixels in that small little device. =) Now what do you want to use the iPad for?
Depends on﻿ how much you are going to spend! iPad 1st gen is $300 or less, iPad 2 is $350, and the newest iPad is $500! So personally I would choose the 2nd gen for $350! Spence
Who the﻿ fuck shoots video with a tablet, dumb Apple company - never changing, never adapting to what's important.
I heard that it overheats alot﻿
Q: How much is that retina display has been exaggerated? I know for a fact that some apps can't be displayed as perfect as the new retina.﻿ Yet, Apple says that reading a ebook from iTunes looks more clearer. But on the iPad 2, it shows the same quality. In other words, that retina is only good for small apps that are made for retina display. Not saying that retina is a gimmick, if anything, it's way ahead of it's time, bracing for new apps that can be viewed in retina display. Right?
There is a lot of things u can do with a kind fire. Fill applications on line, forms,books,movies. Prime with unlimited movies, free book a month(you must have a kindle),free shipping. The is unlimited storage in the cloud. If you have a good android smartphone, you don't need an ipad. So I say the﻿ kind fire is more original. So the better choice is the fire.
i hate everything apple because of its child friendly simplicity, blind people friendly sized icons, over heating pocket﻿ warmer phones etc. BUT because of the retina display i actually bought the ipad 3 and the best thing is if you use it casually u probably will charge it once or twice a week.
Its true what he said about people complaining about the battery﻿ heating up. There is just one little thing that's a flaw and it doesn't even make a difference but still people complain because it is literally the ONLY thing they can find that is wrong with it
Nothing better than Samsung products, using Galaxy tab 10.1 from a year Never lagged, battery never over heat,﻿ it is so smooth and speed and now am gonna buy S3 soon
It's a bit unfair to say people are whining about the overheating. Yes, the battery is bigger, but the reality is that this thing can get quite HOT when using it for a while. Just because it's "beautiful" doesn't make the heat issue any better. Particularly for those of us who live in hot climates. Saying that we "should take it back to﻿ the store" is a bit silly. If we have to take it back to the store then that's a DESIGN issue. And it should be reviewed and marked down accordingly.
I think it was honest review, went over some drawbacks﻿ like heating, lack of widgets. Praised the display, graphics power. Thanks!
@hisalil Just Got my New iPad today, and I am able to use it with the keyboard dock. It is slightly trickier to get the﻿ New iPad connected to the dock, due to the New iPads curved edge though
@Ladida451 Just Got my New iPad today, and I am able to use it with the keyboard dock. It is slightly trickier to get the New iPad connected to the dock, due to the﻿ New iPads curved edge though
iam going to wait on the next﻿ full sized ipad i heard there is going to be another full sized ipad in 2013 and i hope apple puts 8 megapixals on the rear facing camera that will be sweet
forget this,just go and buy a Samsung﻿ galaxy note 10.1,,
question: is the white ipad 3 really﻿ as distracting as people claim it is?
After owning the iPad 3﻿ for just under two months, I would just like to say how FANTASTIC the screen really is. That aside, the rest of it, is simply terrible! Choppy apps store when scrolling through the charts, unresponsive screen and shutting down apps half way though. Not to mention the apps still not optimised!﻿ Plus, the 4:3 aspect ratio means I lose valuable real estate when watching HD movies. Back to Android tablets, as they are light years ahead with a far more comprehensive OS
@Samuel MacGregor thanks! Yeah the new lightning﻿ connected is pretty useless, so you would highly recommend the new ipad over the mini?
tab﻿ 2 is better..
Even after watching this video﻿ I still want a google nexus 7
How did you manage to get the 3G working? I have also tried a Vodafone dongle, I see signal﻿ strength and carrier, but 3G will not enable?
Waiting for the WINDOWS﻿ 8 SLATES :-)
who﻿ need this?
what I don't like is how you show the tablet's performance with a live wallpaper, two myzine widges (processor intensive) and a ton of others, randomly located on the homescreens. I mean, it looks like you﻿ haven't actually used it, because who uses that configuration? I know the tegra2 isn't the fastest in the world, but it does its job quite well, when used "properly" or normally.
Not a fan..of﻿ this tablet
the transformer is﻿ better.....;)
who the heck needs another psychical keyboard. the﻿ screen is big enough to fit a nice keyboard
Why not﻿ in ICS?
Might aswell just buy﻿ a laptop.
No GSM﻿ = goodbay...
Waiting for new iPad.﻿ :)
iPad 3 comes in March Lot better lol﻿ !plastic shit
Dual core is nice but﻿ who would get this over the prime?
I have the original transformer and it's pretty heavy as is. I can imagine the one with the slider keyboard is tough to use cause of its weight.﻿
iPad 3﻿ is better
if they say that,tell 'em﻿ that the Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime 2 is better :D
I can't tell for sure. And, there is the matter of subjective reviewing. But overall, we know that the iPad 3 will be better than the iPad 2...and since the iPAd 2 is better than this...using logic, we can﻿ infer that the iPad 3 will be better than this...
your a major apple fanboy- u show me the ipad 3 that youve seen and﻿ prove to me that the specs are better then this and ill shut up. until then your full of shit
hey asus, do you want﻿ to make a wining tablet???? throw some quad-core process, reduce the size by 50%, improve the design and materials used, give it android 4.0 ics, and make it 50 dollars less than the upcoming ipad3.
How riduculous would u look holding that phone? =﻿ very ridiculous.
i﻿ don't want the eee pad slider. i want the gameboy! :-o
I think﻿ I'll wait for a slimmer more powerful version.
I really hope Asus makes﻿ a Windows 8 tablet with the hardware of the transformer series, I love Android but Windows 8 looks very impressive
i think this tablet it so expensive and not good. without﻿ SIM Card. ooh...........i dislike it
Bad reviews and no contact with UK buyers about shipping date which﻿ is now overdue ! Bad start.
Just received my tablet and bottom corner of screen doesn't work ie back button go l m k﻿ p and o keys when the keyboard is up. Now waiting on customer support. Worth the wait then.
you can tell﻿ the build quality is rubbish
Was looking at getting this device or an Archos 70, does﻿ anyone have any feedback on which one is better? Mainly want it for some flash videa, and the playback of movies through HDMI to my living room TV. Also how is the Android operating system on th Kogan, as I heard rumours the early ones were a bit buggy?
Email arrived - not clear specs. My eBay 7inch tablet had usb via a rare add-on gadget. 3.5mm audio socket - Kogan specs do not mention this. Had poor purchase with Kogan: 2 DEAD PIXELS is ok, even if bright dazzling light spots in the centre of the screen. It was the third LED TV that I had bought﻿ from Kogan, Melbourne. They don't care about costumer loyalty, nor bad press publicity.
So that you can't hear the tablet making zero or poor quality﻿ noise.
No, no, no. You didn't do the intro right. You have to go: "This is Lisa from mobile TECH review" Anyway, this tablet is kinda disappointing. It doesn't offer anything different from cheaper tablets. With a thick tablet you﻿ would either expect more performance or more battery life. In my opinion, this should be $350. There's no reason to choose this over a Transformer.
Ive done a comparison between the sony s and the galaxy tab 10.1 and i noticed that the sony doesnt have a task manager, ultimately﻿ leaving the device to start running slow as you cant clear RAM!
small cord on the charger isnt optimal yeah but you know you could always use an﻿ extension cable^^
i really like this tablet but seriously .... the reset button on the side really scares me﻿ ...
SONY﻿ TABLET = SHIT
micro usb? idiots! Give us﻿ a real port like the acer a500.
I've read some reviews and they said the sony S has few user memory, like less than 9GB, is that correct? is there any way of having more﻿ without an SD card?
I have read that this tablet doesnt support netflix and has limited apps that are working correctly since its so new on the market.....Is this correct﻿
Web browsers looks terrible takes a second to scroll -_- was thinking of switching from an﻿ iPad but not now :(
I have the original iPad and I had Sony tablet S in my hand. Sony feels cheap but the most important thing is the OS - Android﻿ sucks. Take the iPad, honestly :)
The Only Reason I'm Not Getting A Tablet Is Because You Can't Get iTunes And I Don't Want An iPad.. Is There Any﻿ Other Way Of Syncing Music From Tab To iPhone?
The only thing I am not impressed by is build qaulity. (Made in China). The rounded part near the power/volume controls﻿ begins to squeak and become slightly loose. Very annoying noise whe holding. Exchanged mine and same thing happend after a week.
I don't like﻿ this desing
design﻿ of this thing is ugly. VIZIO is my standing choice for my first tablet.
because the Ipad2 is the big boss of the tablets and﻿ everyone want to beat it
I would fault them for that ridiculous charger. Any of the other tablets that make use of a charger with USB plug do come with a short cord yes, but you can easily purchase a USB extension if you'd like a longer cord. I've purchased a 15ft usb extension for my tablet and it works wonderfully. Meanwhile my charger and main cord are small enough for me to travel with much more easily than with a laptop style charger. After all that is﻿ the point to using a tablet isn't it?
hi lisa! debating between a tablet s and a xoom. the sony pretty much sold me when i first played with it﻿ at my local store, but what i hear is that the problems will be when using outdoors. low brightness and bad speakers, also hear battery life is short. can u shed some light on this? any ideas on which one to get between xoom and tablet s? ive narrowed it down to the 2 and dont think ill need a quad core for what ill be doing (movies, comics, surfing, etc)
Yah I played with it yesterday @India Sony Tablet launch and I was pretty Impressed with the quality and design. Though body could be little better but I guess they used plastic to keep﻿ the weight light...
i bought the﻿ sony tablet s 32gb and the wifi stoped working! everything is fine please reply
Is it just me or does the screen look really dark? Is it LCD or LED like the iPad 2? It seems like the ipad 2 is﻿ brighter and easier to see...
i just won this﻿ tablet but i have no use for it.
All﻿ Talets are nice & big. But the APPLE iPad 2 seems to better the leading one. The best tablet
I've got a question about android tablets and phones, is it true the way google makes its money from android interface is by giving your information away? the guy﻿ in bestbuy recommend me an ipad cause unless i was a "hacker" i shouldn't buy a ASUS Transformer Prime.
Oh no wow, Well that's too bad there. why did they create﻿ that port if it were going to have that many problems
excellent review. Why would anyone buy this tablet? So thick and plasticey.. the galaxy S﻿ is so much thinner and nicer to hold
Love Sony products but don't﻿ think this is the best tablet out there. Hopefully they make one that surpasses other tablets.
not the best tablet,but this tablet is cheaper than ipad and 16 gb for $399 :) ipad design is﻿ boring :/
I happen to have both tablets﻿ and I would have to say if you are someone who wants to feel more like using a computer or a laptop go with the Thrive it has a full USB port Full SD card slot and Full HDMI slot but, if you are looking for performance, HD performance, cozy touch and reader go with the Sony S I love both of my tablets and hope this helps you please reply thanks.
It's nice but for the price I wish it's made of aluminum or magnalium. Otherwise I'd﻿ rather buy the Transformer Prime.
My only complaint﻿ is that the camera facing you shows darker than the outer camera for videos and not to compatible with Skype.....other than that....I like it alot and I love how light and mobile it is plus it's not too big or too small,very readable.
I've heard there are wifi problems with this tablet. Can anybody confirm these or has﻿ the latest updates (3.2 or the latest ics) fixed these issues? Thanks :)
I have a sony tablet and the speakers are real " good for nothin﻿ "
hey lisa, by accident wen I restored my tablet all my sony default wallpapers were somehow deleted, is﻿ der any way of getting them bac
Hey just to check i been hearing Sony S tablet has wifi problems could you do a review on the﻿ new ics update on the tablet just wanna know whether the new ics update solved the wifi problems thanks
i have it, it has problems playing MKV files...i dont know how to stop the lag... even when watching hd﻿ streams on sopcast, it can play some but others are in slow motion which i assume are MKV streams... hope they fix it cause its a great tablet
A work intern was so so kind to let me navigate thru his Sony Tablet. It's so stylish. The keyboard is receptive. The camera pictures came out extremely beautiful. What bugged me was that it doesn't come with a stand so you gotta get a hard cover case and just make it stand like that. What I didn't reconfirm with my senses is whether﻿ it has a USB jack so that I can insert in a external hard drive etc. Can anyone confirm this? Oh! i realised that this is a year old. Is there a new one comin?
Thx i whas looking for the resolution about the screen but it seem's that the galaxy is﻿ brighter so ima get that one
That's too bad. Guess I won't buy a﻿ Sony then...
Ill﻿ stick with my ipad 3
Got my Sony Tablet S 16GB over the wknd and it's great. Very fast, very light, and the remote control app is the best. I also got the charging cradle which works brilliantly. My only complaint would be that the remote control app does not include the PS3, but I suspect this has more to do with Logitech Harmony remotes than Sony. Overall if you only need a Wi-Fi and not a wireless tablet IMHO this is the best hands﻿ down.
i use it for a month! that enought﻿ for me
is anyone experiencing problems with﻿ this tablet? like on the first day it started to freeze a lot! and﻿ kept on going on sleep mode while im using an app, i really thought this tablet would be awesome, but im getting really frustrated :S is there any way this can be solved?
I bought this tab a week ago and honestly I am loving it. The only problem I have is watching videos on the﻿ youtube app. It does buffer a lot which is a pain.
Had mine for a few weeks now and am very happy with it. Battery life is good....can get a full day out of it watching movies and playing games. It's very responsive, but the only thing that lets it down is the Android marketplace; it really doesn't compare to the Ios. However, there are apps on Android that cover most of the reqiurements i need, so overall i am happy with﻿ this purchase.
Lol love the cat at the end. As for the Tablet itself, I like the stylus. Just wish it had more use for it. The Lenovo Thinkpad MyNotes would be awesome﻿ on this thing. Too bad Motorola prices these things way to high.
love that cat. and the tablet﻿ looks really good, but it is WAAAAYYYYYY too expensive... i mean almost $900 for a 64GB tablet... im gonna get a cheaper tablet, or maybe the Galaxy Nexus
skip﻿ this tablet and go for Asus transformer prime!
Unless you desperately NEED to have access to 4G or 3G, there is absolutely no reason to buy this or any other﻿ tablet over the ASUS transformer prime... Lisa please do a review on the prime. I already watched some but i always wait for your reviews :) You're very thorough.
Motorola should make a razr tablet, meaning thinner than the﻿ ipad 2.
get the﻿ transformer prime
Give us a Razr tablet.﻿
XYBoard? I dont know about that name :/ Xoom﻿ was way better. Looks like a solid tablet but i already preordered the TFprime :)
Why is it so expensive when its hardware is behind the asus TF Prime? i really wanted to get this product﻿ till i heard the price. if the price werent so high, i might get this over the asus...but i guess ASUS win me over this time. =(
i'm not getting a﻿ tablet until they do 1080p display ...
anyway﻿ all these tablets are pathetic. they're just obese phones without call functionality. they're going to give me something i don't already have on my phone to convince me to get a tablet.
Is not a bad tablet and probably is better than all 1gen HC tablets out there but with transformer prime on the horizon and others tablets coming﻿ in next 3-5 months buying any tablet now is not the wiser thing to do
transformer prime better than this tablet, want you to review the prime, since so far you are the most unbiased﻿ reviewer I have seen, keep up the good work, you do excellent reviews
Great review Lisa! The XYboard(pronounced like cyborg) is pricey for what's on the tablet. I already posted on Asus' facebook page that we only trust you to review their﻿ Transformer Prime tablet. Hopefully they send you one soon:-)
No WiFi? ﻿ Big mistake on their part.
Noticeable lag when browsing﻿ photos.
:-( after looking at the gaming﻿ segment I can say I really wish it had tegra 3 inside. games looks as good but not tegra 3 good.
Way too expensive for something that will﻿ be outdated in 6 months. A similarly priced laptop has a lot more functionality and longer usage life.
eee pad transformer!﻿ FTW!
ASUS transformer﻿ prime AHHHHHHHHHHH
I'm a original xoom owner...but will﻿ not be upgrading for a better screen and lower storage. #Fail #Price
I was in the market for the Xoom for its input/output features and then I saw that this came out with its thin design and was wondering if this was worth the extra price. i dont want the Tab 10.1 because of the lack of﻿ USB and HDMI and the Prime would be out of my price range here in Australia.
to sum up, people thought zoom was bulky, expensive and had a poor display. so the geniuses at﻿ motorola produced a successor, that is thin, more expensive and with nominally improved display (not really) while taking away the microsd slot. no wonder apple beats them every day of the week. Note: wifi only version can now be had at moto website for expected prices.
why they put the ports at the bottom? every time you plug something in,﻿ the screen is uneven
Keep the Xoom. It is the only tablet to have 4.0.4 provided﻿ you have the US wifi version.
Good review, but I don't really see why I should﻿ upgrade to this from my original XOOM.
God, motorola is just coming out with more and more shit. The ui on this is shit, the display is shit, the build quality is shit, its probably not gonna get updated﻿ to 4.0 or 4.1.
On the purchase, I ordered my tablet from the Motorola website. It was easy enough; customer service on some follow up items needs a lot to be desired. The free protective portfolio case that came with my purchase is flimsy at best. The﻿ tablet works as mentioned above, I also purchased the USB hot cord to attach flash drives that hold movies; pictures; etc The cost is still one attribute that might keep you away from purchasing the tablet ..but as far as performance, it is outstanding.
I love how your cat appears suddenly﻿ hehehe :) cute! Now back to tablet : I'm not that impressed ,since you can get a quad-core tablet for that money. Plus im looking for a tablet with some keyboard dock since i will probably be typing alot on it. so unless it has a dock keyboard like asus transformer, i dont think i will be buying it. Too bad cause i really like Motorola :) Great review!!
Guys to the Hard drive that doesn't work what i am thinking is the hard drive has to be a Plug and play Hard drive cause some hard drives don't use plug and play and﻿ have internal software that downloads as it plugs in
If you've used the HTC Flyer or Jetstream pen, you will notice that you can write anywhere and in any app which doesn't have to be a note app, an art app or PDF. It can also control anything and anywhere on the screen, unlike with the Lenovo stylus, as you noted, you have to use it on﻿ certain parts of the screen.
not my type of tablet that tablet is﻿ more for business im waiting anyway to buy a tablet til icecreamsandwhic(4.0) comes out
the stock notes app is bad for free hand note taking. Its somtimes not precise in erasing quickly. Some locations on the screen dont even take input from the pen. Lenovo needs to really update on this app since its their main feature app. Can anyone recommend a really good app﻿ for note taking. Has evernote indicated that they would support digitizer pen support?
I like this. but please reviews samsung 7 series﻿ slate pc - its the best tablet now
I want this so badly but it's soo thick and thats﻿ a huge issue for me
please do not buy this fucking computer, i paid $1,073 for my thinkpad and it has sucked the whole time, i had to call support for the third time today to send someone out to my house to fix it and i've only had the thing for 4 months,and i've been extremely careful taking care of it.just buy a﻿ fucking macbook for the love of god, if you're going to drop a G on a laptop
Hey, good review thanks. I bought one. I can't get it to see my usb drives. (same as you). I plug in a powered or non-powered external drive, and nothing happens. I purchased a file management ap and can't see the drives. The usb keyboard works. any ideas?﻿
why the﻿ add a sim slot if it doesnt work ? lenovo is a shit company that want to gain a name by selling un-studied stuff that doesnt work !! i wouldnt even buy this for my little son
To﻿ be honest, I would be a lot more interested in the tablet if it didn't have the same shitty fingerprint magnet black plastic front as every other tablet on the market. It's a very anti-thinkpad characteristic, being something that looks great in a showroom but is a bane upon the existence of anyone having to use it.
I looked at this tablet before deciding on getting an Ipad, I was looking at some drawing software (Sketchbook) and pen and liked the fact that the Lenovo thinkpad comes with one (although optional), furthermore I had bought a used Thinkpad laptop when it was still IBM for 300 bucks and loved it. Did my research and because none of the 6 different major electronic stores﻿ in town had it physically in the store I decided to go for the IPad. Great review by the way, I don't regret the IPad...
Yes there is going to come with out﻿ the thinkpad tablet 2 running on Windows 8. It will no longer run android anymore =(
I﻿ thought the same thing, until i seen some demo videos of people using the browser. Its not as smooth as the ipad, and is a bit laggy. That being said, the Tab is a good device. I think RIM's PlayBook beats em both.
copy from apple's﻿ ipad not cool...
i don't it is actually pocketable as they﻿ try to present it in the commercial not it would not replace the cellphone
My Samsung Galaxy Spica﻿ phone costs over 4 (FOUR) times less, and can do 99% of things that Galaxy Tab does
Sure, it's nice. But seriously, look at the design. It looks﻿ like a phone
it is a piece of shit. too small to do anything that tablets are good for.and too big to be any use as a phone. i would buy an ipad any day of the week over this overrated piece of shit. btw, carriers are releasing it on broadband packages (high amout of downloads and very very small calls allowance. its not designed to be a phone which is the only feature it has up on the ipad. ALSO people who take conferencing seriously﻿ wouldn't use it for a business meeting.they have conference rooms and shit
haha we copied it of ipad and improved it u mad? still sucks compared to a normal laptop﻿ though
@ForsTrucks555 even if its 999 times better it still sucks compared to having a﻿ phone and a laptop
samsung sucks, all korean brands﻿ sucks
the iPad was supposed to replace the computers, but it does not support flash player. i know that the ios is more user friendly than android, but you can﻿ do way more with android. please tell me how the ios is better than android
this is such bull. why does everybody have to copy apple. look closely at the camera at the back... doesnt it look exactly like iphone 4s camera with the flash? and the keyboard and everything!!!!! samsung go eat shit and die!!!﻿
what a bullshit ass excuse for a wannabe ipad﻿
iPad is﻿ better
you'd look﻿ like such a knob just carrying that around
Overrated - yes, bad products? - no The iPad is extremely overrated and I expected more from apple in their tablet-entry, but it is still a solid, fun and very good product. Apple will not﻿ win the tablet war, this is the ultimate opportunity for the competitors... The iPhone is another matter as it is simply the best phone on the market when it comes to all-round performance and offering here. The price is way to high though...

A matter of taste, i prefer the﻿ iphone 4 because of the UI (touch response included) and the design, camera and screen. But the galaxy S is still a bloody good phone!
Tablets are dumn.. atleast the ones out right now.. they can do the same ass shit that a Smartphone can﻿ do.. the HTC Evo can do all of these and even though its big its way smaler then this.. same with thew new ipod touchs exacly like an pad
idk y people say apple is better if u look at it 1 out of 10 people own a mac mac isnt going to go very far in life the only have 1 type of computer while there are like 50 other companies making﻿ computers with windows i give apple maybe ten years the only thing they make good is their ipods
Fail﻿ tab?
true but﻿ the ipad has multitouch which alot of touch computers don't have.
in holland this tab is more expensive﻿ than a Ipad S: this one is 529 euro and a ipad is 499 euro
NO HONEYCOMB. Galaxy Tab is obsolete. No response from Samsung support. Samsung is﻿ a coward.
@ThomasTheAleeycat. are you retarded. you get flash player through jailbreak and ipad 2﻿ has a camera. who the fuck would put a camera on an ipad. its like trying to take good photos with a laptop camera. the apps on ios are way better even if they are not free. and you can get way better apps from jailbreak too. bump is like bluetooth. you don't know what ur talking about
wow... 529 euro﻿ is really some money... Hmm. In Romania a Samsung Galaxy Tab is 349 euro , and an ipad is 650 euro ... xD
I hate this thing it﻿ copied Ipad...BIYATCHESSSSA
Neh,﻿ too small
iPad﻿ will always be the best
Yea if samsung galaxy tab or any other tablet is so good﻿ Why!? everyone want an iPad i own both and iPad runs smother,doesn't lag,bigger crispier screen...and much more
ipad is﻿ the best
