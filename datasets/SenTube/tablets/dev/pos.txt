I def agree that there is more than just Apple. I am a big Sony fan, actually--have had one of their laptops for 3 years now and it still runs like a Lexus. But, I just don't﻿ think Sony is getting it in these harsh economic times. $499 is too much for any tablet--most of their items are just not priced right for me. I'm not paying $550 with tax for a Sony tablet or any other right now.
I think this better than Galaxy tab 10.1 ... And﻿ best Android tablets
well you bring up a good point--and Sony just lowered the price. But it seems like a good tablet compared to others. There must have﻿ been other non-Apple tablets there.
well that is great. I﻿ believe it is supposed to be the best Android tablet yet. Glad it's working for you. I would like one too :)))
not sure what that's supposed﻿ to mean, but this really is a hideous device in my opinion. I have a galaxy tab 10.1 myself and although I'm not a huge fan of Samsung I love the sleekness of the galaxy tab.
Nice design﻿
now just add an hdmi out and were good to﻿ go
still it's faaaaaaar better than the other lame P﻿ model..!!
The design of this tablet﻿ is awsome!
I agree it looks﻿ really neat
design is brilliant because it has a purpose, you can keep it on the table and it lies at an angle perfect for viewing, you can't hold the tablet for ever your hands will get tired, you can watch movies n stuff by just keeping in on the desk and you don;t have to lean forward to get best view angles.﻿ awesome!
I have it iits﻿ great
yea.... i wouldn't drop it because its only made﻿ out of plastic and basic glass have a look at the Toshiba tablet ( its coming out in a few days) its got new gorilla glass and has a aluminum back :) f.y.i ..... i might still by the sony though XD
I have it. And it is a very nice tablet, now is runing the oficial ics that﻿ have been realese not that long ago and that makes it even better. And the design it is realy top, very well done.
I like Sony I want﻿ this
I love﻿ sony very much.
yeah cuz they were using shitty prcessors and i have all my archos devices from the 404 so idk what youre doing but﻿ mine allll work great. i do admit the android tablets have been sluggish and the hardware has been incompetent but this device shows new life in this company i think. you have to keep in mind that the software is google metalslugmasters so bash google for that little freeze up. the omap4 is going to dominate anything out there. research this and give it a chance.
so uh its realy uh nice uh its got﻿ nice uh viewing uh angles
i got an ipad 2 but this﻿ still looks really cool
Viewing angles are better than previous﻿ generation, though still far from being top notch.
nice! i will buy it! ahaha! =))﻿
i wana fuck the ipad﻿ its so damn sexy
This thing is soo much more useful than the XOOM!﻿ More apps! and now even faster!
Awesome review! iPad 2 Smart Cover is﻿ amazing thing though
i﻿ don't know but I think it looks more futuristic
No,﻿ because it looks Sexy.
yupp the ipad is just like gold necklaces.even though they are nice﻿ they both look cheap anyway.
I want it too. I think its really well looking in the white colour and quick. My﻿ uncle has one and there very light and thin. I want one, there really cool!
love my ipad 2 its also my first tablet ever too﻿
I really like apple for their iPods, but for﻿ phones and tablets, i like samsung and motorola devices better
Just got my iPad 2 .. Amazing!!!﻿
Nothing can beat Apple (iPad and iPhone) in terms of amazing user experience. No lags, no glitches. Everything just works! I am extremely happy to drop Android for iOS.﻿
Haha I like that! You are one of few who actually admits that iOS is﻿ better than Android! :)
I just heard tha the iPad 3 is already giving people shit. I have an iPad 2 and its my﻿ second love :)
iPad 2 is amazing plan to buy it in next﻿ month :D
Why? You just have more storage. And yeah, it might be a little bit slower... but you get so much more storage.﻿
Man Im cainda﻿ sad that I bought iPad 2 :(
i've only owned archos brand pmp/tablet devices - and it looks like the g9 series isn't﻿ doing anything to make me change my mind about that! i'm going to get the 8" model with 32gb flash drive.
I like ArchosGEN9﻿
when he mentioned the resolution of WVGA of 800x480 i stopped watching. THATS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE DELL!!! FK YOU! AND YOUR CORPORATION. I DONT BELIEVE IT!!?? not ONE engineer said﻿ "Hey! that resolution kinda sucks, we should at least do a 1024x768 for a better viewing experience" Apparently not! they chose the same resolution of most smartphones out on the market to date. it has the tegra 2 dual core for a HUGE plus! but that resolution is just ridiculous and proves that dell doesnt give a shit!
i like the windows﻿ 7 tablet its cool lil bit...btw how much is that?
Glad to see﻿ minimal design input here, its quite refreshing
good﻿ review. terrible product.
IKR?! It's one of the most STUPID design decisions ever. The Galaxy Tab is nowhere near as powerful CPU/GPU wise, yet Samsung bothered to put 1024x600, so why didn't Dell? :L It's bizarre that they﻿ bothered making the rest of the tablet high end, yet decided to put in a low resolution and quality screen. Fucking idiots :D
Some people (including myself) like that screen size. Imo it is the most practical. However, the screen is disgustingly bad, and I don't know what the hell Dell were thinking when they put it in there. 800x480 on a 7" display is pathetic. Battery should have been way better too. Imo, 2.2 works really great as﻿ a small tablet OS though.
Good tablet, with exceptions too screen res﻿ and the fact that it runs froyo. btw does anyone know if this will get the update to 3.0?
There may be reasons behind this. Personally, a dual-core tablet with a non-removable battery already sucks battery life.﻿ Maybe increasing the resolution would take too much power. Personally, other than the resolution and the battery life, I have yet to see anything under $450 that can compete with this tablet. At least, not as far as Android goes.
You guys complain like little bitches, I have the Dell Streak 7 and the screen is fine, I know everyone has there own opinions but seriously? Do you really need a high res screen? Plus, most 7 inch tablets have an 800x480 screen resolution. So quit your damn bitchin﻿ and live with it or get a different tablet.
This tablet doesn't seem too bad. I mean u have﻿ a high end spec of 1ghz 2x. Hmm this probably the best tablet I've seen that has power and is cheap. For $280 ur getting more than what you pay for from what I've seen. Idk the full specs but seems good either way.
I saw the Dell Streak 7 in person﻿ and the screen is clearer than you would think...
I'm thinking about grabbing one as a budget tablet w/ a sim card slot.I've noticed prices getting real cheap on these Dell Streak 7 tablets, but the biggest con is the low resolution screen with such bad viewing angles. I really wish Dell had put in a better screen when this first came out last year. However, with the Nook Tablet, Amazon Kindle Fire﻿ HD and Nexus 7 Tablet all selling at the $200 price range, this isn't a value unless you realy want a tablet w/ a sim card slot.
nice design from lg with those to camers they made a penis with google written on﻿ it
the thunderbolt dies in 2 1/2 hours. It sucks. Droid X﻿ 2
Dude, LG should remove their freakin Smily logo. It's making their﻿ product look so much cheesier than it is. No their products arent bad at all but their logo is just sooo ugly! >:(
I bought LG pad and have no regrets. It's much better than I expected, extremely fast and every single functions work properly. One thing, it's just really fast.﻿
No ICS kinda lame...anyways im gettin this﻿ 2 in one week and it seems like cool tablet :D
Hey! Yeah im certain you should﻿ get the iPad 3, that £100 extra will get you a lot more features. I would go for the iPad 3 if i was you, you will not be disappointed :)
I gotta say m8y, That review was very good :) I was going to go for a New iPad, But i'm not sur ethat i want to part with my money for something that i feel i slightly missing something, I love how Apple has implimented the new retinal display & upped the﻿ camera Res, But i still want expandable memory,Better front camera,etc,etc. so i think i shall wait just a little longer to see what come's out next time.
carrying something lighter wherever you go﻿ to. tablets are substitute of desktop pc's/laptops.
The﻿ iPad 2's battery lasts longer, and is supposedly a bit more faster. The new iPad has Retina Display, as in a lot of pixels in that small little device. =) Now what do you want to use the iPad for?
Cool I want the﻿ ipad :)
where did you get your wallpaper? i like it﻿ can you link me?
Q: How much is that retina display has been exaggerated? I know for a fact that some apps can't be displayed as perfect as the new retina.﻿ Yet, Apple says that reading a ebook from iTunes looks more clearer. But on the iPad 2, it shows the same quality. In other words, that retina is only good for small apps that are made for retina display. Not saying that retina is a gimmick, if anything, it's way ahead of it's time, bracing for new apps that can be viewed in retina display. Right?
what case have you got on your 4/s? I like﻿ the look of it :)
Gotta Love the New Ipad. Personally, I think this﻿ tablet is the best on the market and this review is even better. Nice Review!
I hate widgets. so glad apple﻿ doesn't have them. although the ones in notification centre is okay
I﻿ just bought my iPad and so dar I love it! Good review
I do, it take really nice photos, even though its big so what im already using a wide screen tablet outside anyway. Why not use a great video camera that records in 1080p higher then some﻿ people cell phones video camera.
yes!﻿ retina display and quad-core graphics are amazing.. and with iOS 6 you'll have Siri!
i hate everything apple because of its child friendly simplicity, blind people friendly sized icons, over heating pocket﻿ warmer phones etc. BUT because of the retina display i actually bought the ipad 3 and the best thing is if you use it casually u probably will charge it once or twice a week.
Fantastic tablet. I use the new iPad to design graphics when i am not in the office, and AT&T's 4G LTE makes sending﻿ graphics very quick (4G is available in NY, where i live).
I was looking at buying my first iPad, and going through﻿ the differences of the iPad2 and the iPad3.. the 3 seems a lot better because of the retina display, as a photographer it's a great advantage and will let me show my pictures on a great screen wherever I am. :)
Its true what he said about people complaining about the battery﻿ heating up. There is just one little thing that's a flaw and it doesn't even make a difference but still people complain because it is literally the ONLY thing they can find that is wrong with it
i just upgraded from a 2 ...wow! im a what you﻿ say aaaaa happy! wiiii....trollolololol
I think it was honest review, went over some drawbacks﻿ like heating, lack of widgets. Praised the display, graphics power. Thanks!
@hisalil Just Got my New iPad today, and I am able to use it with the keyboard dock. It is slightly trickier to get the﻿ New iPad connected to the dock, due to the New iPads curved edge though
@Ladida451 Just Got my New iPad today, and I am able to use it with the keyboard dock. It is slightly trickier to get the New iPad connected to the dock, due to the﻿ New iPads curved edge though
IPad﻿ 3 rules
Cool i'm gonna﻿ get one!
2048X1536 da fuk?!?? better that your HDTV﻿
the﻿ screen is fuckin beautiful
@GammerDanni- mine seems﻿ to hold alot of apps, pics/videos.. I'm super stoked on mine!
After owning the iPad 3﻿ for just under two months, I would just like to say how FANTASTIC the screen really is. That aside, the rest of it, is simply terrible! Choppy apps store when scrolling through the charts, unresponsive screen and shutting down apps half way though. Not to mention the apps still not optimised!﻿ Plus, the 4:3 aspect ratio means I lose valuable real estate when watching HD movies. Back to Android tablets, as they are light years ahead with a far more comprehensive OS
what I don't like is how you show the tablet's performance with a live wallpaper, two myzine widges (processor intensive) and a ton of others, randomly located on the homescreens. I mean, it looks like you﻿ haven't actually used it, because who uses that configuration? I know the tegra2 isn't the fastest in the world, but it does its job quite well, when used "properly" or normally.
thumbs up if﻿ you love the keyboard
Dual core is nice but﻿ who would get this over the prime?
If you﻿ want to do any sort of productive work a real keyboard helps.
holy shit this looks﻿ awsome:X
im getting really sick of the ipads better stuff. first off the ipad 3 istnt even out yet, noone had a frickin idea what it will be like so dont go﻿ sayin that bullshit that ipads better. android works too jeez!!!! im sorry this thing looks soooo cool and i can name at least 5 tablets that are better than the ipad
i know slider, phonearena wants to bring﻿ you down.. but i know ur something special... all android devices are.
@zwansaurio, its faster than the﻿ iPad....
I really hope Asus makes﻿ a Windows 8 tablet with the hardware of the transformer series, I love Android but Windows 8 looks very impressive
first of all thats not a phone its an asus Eee pad slider second of all you would look cool holding it and how do u﻿ even know anything about if u don't have it?!!!!
i think this would suit me﻿ down to the ground for work best of both worlds.
Nice - but will it go on sale in﻿ the USA?
I﻿ received my replacement a couple of days ago and must say I am quite impressed now I have a fully functional unit. Plays itv player and 3d games well :)
Glad to hear﻿ you're enjoying it :-)
It will play videos fine without ghosting. Your long train journeys﻿ should become a little less boring :)
That's pretty good, can I﻿ ask how long the charging time is?
Yep - just check out the Google Play store and you'll﻿ see plenty of fun games there with great graphics!
Really﻿ nice tablet.
I like your thorough run thru in your reviews.﻿ Im impressed that this tablet does so much and im happy to see that android tablets can be very different from each other.
I﻿ don't know why, but I like this tablet the most. (besides the iPad of course)
Excellent review, Lisa (as﻿ usual). This is as close to 'try before you buy' without actually handling the device. I've had this device on pre-order for a few weeks and look forward to handling it. Your review validates my choice to try it out. Thank you for your hard work. I tell everyone to check out your site when asked. Cliff
The Sony Tablet S is excellent for reading books and playing videos. It doesn't come with an Office suite however, you can download free﻿ versions for viewing and paid versions for editing. It reads PDF beautifully.
this is a﻿ very nice tablet the sony each time excels
i love sony.﻿ like.no.other
i really like this tablet but seriously .... the reset button on the side really scares me﻿ ...
Thanks for the review. You sound professional and human at the same time, something that many other people﻿ need to work on. Great product too!
I'm buying it over Asus, Samsung, LG etc just for the fact its Japanese and Sony ;) iPad 2?? Hmm I﻿ have an iPhone 4
Same here! I love Japanese brands...and Japan! My girlfriend is﻿ Japanese....also it's such an unique tablet!!
my friend just got this tablet its soooooooooo coool﻿
cheers mate, I am planning to purchase an android tablet, as I need my toy to play flash. I am confused between Samsung galaxy and sony, I tried playing with them in shop and I felt Sony is faster then﻿ Samsung galaxy (your comments please) or have you heared of Archos 101 G9﻿ (Only issue I think it has got 512 RAM instead of 1 GB). Please advise
Got to love tablets with sd card slot and usb for the﻿ external storage supports. I was going to buy the ipad 2 but this looks pretty slick
It didn't. But Netflix finally is available for Android Honeycomb tablets﻿ now. We tested it on the Sony Tablet S, it worked fine.
Great review. Dropped mine on hardwood floor from waist height, no damage.﻿ Best tablet on market imo.
great review!! it helped me decide to pick one up the other day, (16gig model) it's just fantastic. ps1 games are a little tricky to play, but work great. Even comes with some great apps right out of﻿ the box..
One of the best tablets in the world iPad 2 Sony tablet s in my﻿ option
i love you so much sony﻿
i think the sony is much better but if u want more information reply to me and i will give help about what u should buy.i am an expert in Tablets and i have lot of yser experience﻿
Great Reveiw, This kills this Kills the Ipad, cant wait to get﻿ this
Even though the tablet S is quite new, I was﻿ wondering if you got any news regarding a tegra 3 tablet from Sony? I kinda like this tablet, but with all the tegra 3 tablets coming up... I just don't know, whether its a smart move for me.
I got to play with this a little bit today at Brand Smart. I gotta say that﻿ I at first wanted the Acer Iconia, but I think I finally found the tablet that's right for me.
never mind by the end of this video I decided to go with the﻿ sony lol
Yah I played with it yesterday @India Sony Tablet launch and I was pretty Impressed with the quality and design. Though body could be little better but I guess they used plastic to keep﻿ the weight light...
Dude, I have﻿ the Tablet S, The battery life is standard. It's like the other tablets. I don't have complaints about the battery life. Same with the speakers. Any tablet can look bad with sunlight. It depends on the display. I recommend the S Tablet because, it's feel and design which makes it simply beautiful
1 quick question. So I'm new to tablets and﻿ stuff but I think this is the right one for me. Anyway this might sound stupid but can you make a shortcut of a website say on one of the desktops or the app-page?
this is truly﻿ an amazing tablet, whatching this on one right now
I would think so, as long﻿ as you can read pdf files and other documents, you should be pretty good. best thing about this, it has ports like you can find the Micro usb cable and connect whatever to it.
The ports are definitely a plus.﻿ Scored the 16GB yesterday, downloaded the Office to Go app (just the free version), and I'm glad I made the decision to get it. Loving it so far!
Love Sony products but don't﻿ think this is the best tablet out there. Hopefully they make one that surpasses other tablets.
not the best tablet,but this tablet is cheaper than ipad and 16 gb for $399 :) ipad design is﻿ boring :/
I happen to have both tablets﻿ and I would have to say if you are someone who wants to feel more like using a computer or a laptop go with the Thrive it has a full USB port Full SD card slot and Full HDMI slot but, if you are looking for performance, HD performance, cozy touch and reader go with the Sony S I love both of my tablets and hope this helps you please reply thanks.
After having tried some Android tablets and fairly disappointing myself, I watched this video and it certainly kicked up﻿ my curiosity to try this tablet. I went to Best Buy, put my hands on it and it is awesome. Perfect size for me, perfect grip, perfect weight. Done! I left Best Buy with a brand new one. Thank Lisa, you made one great job with that review!
I like the Sony Tablet﻿ S:)
It's nice but for the price I wish it's made of aluminum or magnalium. Otherwise I'd﻿ rather buy the Transformer Prime.
I bought the prime and it had flaw designs I was very disappointed. If you insert the SD card the wrong way it will get stuck right away, and it will be very painful to remove it. Also, my tablet didn't insert in the keyboard correctly I kept trying it for several times until it was plugged. I don't know about﻿ you, but believe me with Sony you get far better quality, I tried the prime, thrive and the ipad but Sony is the only one that made me happy and satisfied.
I bought 2 android tablets the prime﻿ and toshiba thrive, and now I have the Sony! I am so happy with it, the quality is far better. And it is so comfortable to hold for long periods. The design is unique and the battery is fantastic. I really think it's the best android tablet out there, and I'm not talking tech wise I mean experience wise.
My only complaint﻿ is that the camera facing you shows darker than the outer camera for videos and not to compatible with Skype.....other than that....I like it alot and I love how light and mobile it is plus it's not too big or too small,very readable.
I'm glad Sony aren't just aping the iPad like every other﻿ electronics company.
Awesome job as always Lisa. I really like﻿ this Tablet. I may have to pick this up.
thanks , because of this video I bought the sony tablet and its pure﻿ class :)
i have it, it has problems playing MKV files...i dont know how to stop the lag... even when watching hd﻿ streams on sopcast, it can play some but others are in slow motion which i assume are MKV streams... hope they fix it cause its a great tablet
A work intern was so so kind to let me navigate thru his Sony Tablet. It's so stylish. The keyboard is receptive. The camera pictures came out extremely beautiful. What bugged me was that it doesn't come with a stand so you gotta get a hard cover case and just make it stand like that. What I didn't reconfirm with my senses is whether﻿ it has a USB jack so that I can insert in a external hard drive etc. Can anyone confirm this? Oh! i realised that this is a year old. Is there a new one comin?
TABLET S is sexier looking﻿ than the iPad. expandable memory. sleek design.
Got my Sony Tablet S 16GB over the wknd and it's great. Very fast, very light, and the remote control app is the best. I also got the charging cradle which works brilliantly. My only complaint would be that the remote control app does not include the PS3, but I suspect this has more to do with Logitech Harmony remotes than Sony. Overall if you only need a Wi-Fi and not a wireless tablet IMHO this is the best hands﻿ down.
Updated to ICS as soon as I got﻿ it. No Wi-Fi problems to speak of.
I have the device. Yes, you can do video chats with it it has a front facing and a rear facing camera for taking pictures or video chatting. It truly is a great tablet and i love﻿ it a lot it's about a year old on the market and I still think it's one of the greatest :) hope this helps you
I bought this tab a week ago and honestly I am loving it. The only problem I have is watching videos on the﻿ youtube app. It does buffer a lot which is a pain.
i love android, i love﻿ apple, i love windows(7)...i love all
Yeah looks like﻿ the acer, but really like the red cover
Had mine for a few weeks now and am very happy with it. Battery life is good....can get a full day out of it watching movies and playing games. It's very responsive, but the only thing that lets it down is the Android marketplace; it really doesn't compare to the Ios. However, there are apps on Android that cover most of the reqiurements i need, so overall i am happy with﻿ this purchase.
Lol love the cat at the end. As for the Tablet itself, I like the stylus. Just wish it had more use for it. The Lenovo Thinkpad MyNotes would be awesome﻿ on this thing. Too bad Motorola prices these things way to high.
beautiful!﻿ and the tablet is nice looking too. tehe
love that cat. and the tablet﻿ looks really good, but it is WAAAAYYYYYY too expensive... i mean almost $900 for a 64GB tablet... im gonna get a cheaper tablet, or maybe the Galaxy Nexus
Thank you Lisa for the review, I was waiting for someone one I trusted to review this. A lot of money, but I will gladly pay it. Tried it out in the Verizon store today, I﻿ am very pleased with it.
I'm sure this will sell﻿ THOUSANDS
These things will sell in the TENS.﻿ Flying off the shelves this Christmas season!
Why is it so expensive when its hardware is behind the asus TF Prime? i really wanted to get this product﻿ till i heard the price. if the price werent so high, i might get this over the asus...but i guess ASUS win me over this time. =(
Is not a bad tablet and probably is better than all 1gen HC tablets out there but with transformer prime on the horizon and others tablets coming﻿ in next 3-5 months buying any tablet now is not the wiser thing to do
:-( after looking at the gaming﻿ segment I can say I really wish it had tegra 3 inside. games looks as good but not tegra 3 good.
My﻿ god, that tablet is faster than my home WiFi.
I just took a look at one of these,﻿ and I am amazed at how light it is!
If the Xoom 2 comes to Australia, it's worth the money. It's faster than the Xoom and has more﻿ cool features.
The ipad﻿ is for mindless children. This is the superior tablet for adults.
i am starting﻿ to regret of buying an ipad\
