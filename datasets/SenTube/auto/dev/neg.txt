Volvo is an﻿ old man's car
I know man, but it matches the boringness﻿ of the S60 aaaaannnnd it's color
That is one ugly color.﻿
id take﻿ an audi s4
S4 all﻿ day
Volvo do not give you racing﻿ tiers like Bmw that is bad ;(
Volvos are ment to be a long lasting great riding car and thats it. They were never very good at racing,﻿ like he said buy an audi for racing. And don't tell me i'm wrong cause i've had a lot of volvos and audi.
i know ford owned volvo i could buy a volvo from those years﻿ but id never own one now poor compony, for soo long they had good crash rates but now their gonna be made from tinfoil
Volvo do not got racing tiers like bmw and so﻿ on when you buy it.
my subaru wrx will stomp this volvo﻿ :D
can't say i blame clarkson for that last comment.. an s60r tailgated me awhile back and when he tried to pass me i just waved good bye when i downshifted.﻿ :/
this﻿ car is awesome, but the color is stupid.
i drive a volvo s40 and a bmw 325i The volvo's 5 cylinder provides enough power to feel like you are indeed driving a european car. The sound is pretty good, and the suspension is way better than any american car or a VW BUT the BMW 325i is﻿ a true sports car. it sends you back in your seat a little bit when you push on the accelerator. the 2 times you really feel the difference between the bmw and the volvo is when accelerating on the freeway and when you have to beat a yellow light. BMW wins
yes but... all the performance stuff you mentioned... the BMW M3's are﻿ better
i would still buy the German's....﻿
i would﻿ also buy an audi s4 lol :P
m3 have no turbo and still alot more power.﻿ the volvo have a turbo and way less power = I LOL
I know, the S60 is not a looker, but neither is the M3. I own a Volvo S40 T5 AWD and I love the looks of it, but the S60 is not my favorite. However some people would think is good looking. I invite you to search in youtube Volvo S60 review by gear patrol. It is an informal review but it makes a really good point about the ca,. it is also very funny. Watch it and let me know what you think about﻿ it then. You should also look the one for the Volvo C30 from gear patrol as well.
i'm volvo til﻿ i dont yet i'm unbias. the m3 would piss it sadly
I admit that the AWD system makes the car slower from a roll, but only after about 100 MPH. I'm﻿ still sticking to my R.
hahahah... "its very, very good, so what i'd do is buy an audi s4"... sums﻿ it up perfectly.
best line in the whole video was the end when he﻿ says buy an audi S4
M3﻿ rival? LMAO!!!
Why that color? Ugly as shit﻿
I'll stick with my old school jet black 850, thanks. No ford-owned baby﻿ blue nonsense.
BMW M3 - made for the track. Volvo S60 -﻿ made for the...err world.
the﻿ color scheme...yuck
I have to say, the colors in that car﻿ are terrible!
im still buying one.﻿ That color is horrible tho, eww
I love my Volvo S60 2.4T! Definitely has some interesting Swedish quirks, but nonetheless a﻿ very, VERY good car.
I hope you realize they only test performance cars. The S60 no longer has an "R" model, only an "R-Design" model, which is NOTHING like an "R". The C30PCP was the only true Volvo performance vehicle to come out in quite a long time, and they won't even put it in production. Everything else Volvo makes is just rather boring for the show.﻿
do you realize you can never hate a volvo? sure, there are better cars out﻿ there, but their all cars always looks so pleasant and harmless...a bit like saab...
jesus﻿ what a terrible color scheme
Glad I have an﻿ Audi S4.
True, and that's their key to success. It's hard to find any weak points on a Volvo other than it is so well made and easy to drive it is boring. Just like Sweden﻿ itself I guess..
the color﻿ made me vomit
my father has an s60r, its quite fast, and corners beautifully. but it makes﻿ really wide turns.
Ferrari is still cooler than a﻿ Volvo. Even if the Ferrari had no engine in it at all, I would still rather have the Ferrari. I like the S60 R. I think it's great, but in terms of coolness, heritage, and pedigree it doesn't even come close to any Ferrari.
Volvo says its a rival for the BMW﻿ M3 when it could barely own the 330i
yes but it's far﻿ cheaper and it's the interior is far better (this is the new one) where as the 3 series interior feels about six years old with out i drive
worst color combo﻿ ever
Rival﻿ for the BMW M3 ? Not really...
V70R looks much better. S60 is a small ugly sedan, S80 looks ok,﻿ that larger overhang is al lgood.
Nothing wrong with the car but everything wrong with the marketing. It's no M3 rival. It's a different kind of car. It is more of a rival for an Audi S4 avant, saab HOT or similar but it doesn't look like it﻿ was ever designed to put lap times in. Sack the marketing men. It's just a nice car with a bit more power.
why in the world would i rather have a volvo when i﻿ can sell the ferrari and buy 10 volvos?
the color is so﻿ ugly
Volvo﻿ sucks
whenever i drive an﻿ S60R, i keep wanting to believe it is AWD, technically it is.....but damn its sooo front wheel bias and heavy in front....better traction and easier to drive than a high boost S60 FWD..but yes, very understeery. The 3 active chassis control buttons are freakin awesome though, you can feel the difference. The seats are like true racing seats, with a thick Volvo XC70 soft twist. Basically, way better on the highway than a track because of the weight distribution, and tarction
Buy an﻿ AUDI S4!
Buy an audi S4 :DD﻿
Agreed but in conjunction with﻿ this exterior, it's just plain horrible!
right XD.. weights a little more than m3 and has 43﻿ less horses.. so 3.8 seconds behind is logical.. besides, at altitude.. i.e. the alps, or anywhere else in the world that is above sea level, the m3 losses power fast ¡¡ while the R keeps it.. for exemple, at denver colorado, which is 5000+ feet high, the m3 has about 285 hp, while the R the same 300 hundred, Just at the coast the M3 would beat it... Sad but true, I cant believe no body has realized it yet..
Very Odd-Looking Vehicular﻿ Object - VOLVO
Still love you Volvo. Your may not﻿ be as fast as the Germans, but your still quick, just as safe and much cheaper.
If they wanted this to compete with the M3, it should have AT LEAST 75 more horsepower...that is all. But even with out that, I still﻿ want this car.
The estate is faster on track﻿ and it's a shame that volvo have falken tiers as standard.
The M3 of the day had﻿ 43 more horsepower. This car fills the gap between a 335i and an M3. I have one, and I like it.
I had a T5 slow as hell. It's a low pressure turbo. I beat that thing in my 91﻿ 305 trans am. And that thing was slow as hell.
Worst color combo﻿ ever!
anything﻿ is more reliable than mercedes and bmw...
Well that's not necessarily true either. They're good cars just not as reliable as maybe comparable cars. Volvo's are just more hardy that's all.﻿
This car﻿ is a mechanic's nightmare. This from a mechanic who enjoys the technology of most electronic automotive devices. Too heavy for racing too.
its quite an ugly car to be honest﻿
They just picked the ugliest color. It would look﻿ much better in black, Sapphire Blue or red.
I﻿ think that Volvo is one of those companies that never really get noticed, but what they make can be really good sometimes.
Volvo is safe, that's it Its not fun in any﻿ way
The S60R is a great cruiser for highway overtaking but﻿ its turning radius is horrible.
Indeed! I never tried the S60R, but I had an S60 2.0T.﻿ And oh God, Ford and Dodge pick up trucks used to make U-turns in front of me with ease while I had to stop in mid-turn and reverse in order to make it through.
the newest saabs with the﻿ same haldex awd are much better at handling and turning
I guess all S60s have a bad turning radius because﻿ mine was a FWD.
The 2005 R (v70) is my parent's but I do know most of the details. It hasn't had any central locking issues at all. The only problems it has had that I remember was a worn angle gear (gear that helps﻿ transfer power to the rear in awd volvos... it's too soft) and just lately the active magnetic suspension had issues, but it was a cracked pin on one of the connectors to the chassis computer, so that was cheap. I have a 2000 v70r and it's central locking is getting dodgy, but mostly from age. :)
im a true volvo fan.. but the interial in that car﻿ was awful :S
To bad its the 1st gen S60R not the third Gen that﻿ we have now!!!!
Man,﻿ that's an ugly color
Seats made from David Dickinson (orange leather)...I did LOL at that one!!! It's a rather loud color scheme on that car without﻿ a doubt!
Alfa Romeos are the best﻿ cars for me
Hell ya, Italians allways go first :) i rather take a 500 over this!!!﻿ :D
it only has 5 or 6 cylinder, how﻿ the hell can it compete with the m3?
That car﻿ is fucking ugly.
people are talking about the﻿ car? fuck the car, who is the babe? she is beautiful
I have zero interest in this car and i've watched﻿ this 10 times. :)
Hot chick, car sucks though, not﻿ what I like, sorry! Lol!!
I'm sorry but that car doesn't remind of a beautiful, sexy woman at all. It reminds me of a squat,﻿ ugly toad!
If only it wasn't ugly (the colour scheme doesn't help). I would take an Aventador over these,﻿ it isn't ugly and would save me a lot of money too.
Meh...looks like a £1.4﻿ million pound overgrown audi TT
in 2009 Bugatti﻿ wasn't the fastest the porsche 9ff gt9-r was faster with 259mph which is more than 252mph and 1105bhp and Bugatti with 1001bhp
that's why we're watching. If I had this on my porch, I would be driving not watching it... (Btw, I would spend﻿ my money differently, but that's another discussion).
I personaly likes first one, because the BGM for re-uploaded one is bit﻿ too noisy.
They cut the roof off, and it is still one of the ugliest cars in existence. ﻿
Sorry Bugatti but you are not the fastest open top hypercar in the world well maybe 0-60 but not top speed koenigsegg agera r own that title yeah yeah i know﻿ it not verified yet but you look at the agera r and know it can do it
I hate the veyron, it is so fucking ugly and it really doesn't deserve the title of fastest production car.because Volkswagen (the company that oana Bugatti) loses over half a﻿ million dollars in every car. so it it was just some bullshit made to break a Record and they knew nobody would buy it even at cost.
This car is waste of wealth... I doubt it gives the driving pleasure﻿ such as Porsche and Ferrari give...
Doesn't it﻿ still have the grand sport traits,of sounding really loud?
meh, the ferraris id stock up my garage wit instead of buyin this.﻿ no car is worth that much. certainly not for just goin 200 plus
Ugly as ever. I'd save for﻿ a nice used F1.
i hate bugatti ssc ultimate aero﻿ tt will kill it
It's not﻿ an investment. Think of it as family. Wives don't make you money and neither do children but we still "buy" them....
no shit sherlock the bugatti isnt﻿ fastest car
