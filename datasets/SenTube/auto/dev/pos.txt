Very Very Nice car ...﻿ o_O
thankyou thankyou best car﻿ in the world ;-)
Beautiful car! Lamborghini did it again! This is why I love Italian cars, beautiful and hi-tech at﻿ the same time. I would buy this car.
because the Gallardo is not nearly as wide﻿ as the Murcielago/Aventador... but yeah it would still be cool!
Lamborghini rocks! I love American but when it comes to this car, who can't﻿ love it?
If this car was a person, I would have sex with﻿ it....
I think the 2004 Galladro is still one hell of a car.﻿ This﻿ car is still nice and fast, but its too racy looking for my tastes. I would also rather have italian leather than Alcantara.
wow... i don't normally like lamborghinis, but﻿ when i do, i like this fantastic looking convertible. good review kyle!
LOOK﻿ AT THOSE L-E-D LIGHTS..... OMG!!!!
I love Lambos!﻿
wow,﻿ what a beautiful car
Always loved the Gallardo, but not sure about this front﻿ bumber? Is it stock?
my dream﻿ car :P
that is ELECTROMECHANICAL ENGINEERING <3 :')﻿
the base price for this vehicle is $258,000. not bad for a car that does 17 mpg(hwy), and goes from 0-60 in about﻿ 3.45 sec. i really wish i can afford one :(
Nice carr﻿
If only I have the money...﻿
Not a big fan of the Tachometer and﻿ Speedometer, but everything else is beautiful.
who need a radio when you have a sweet sound v10 at﻿ your back
I call Gallardos the Honda﻿ Civics of supercars!
this car is﻿ so sexual.
I Love This﻿ Car ;)))))
i like those﻿ new taillights
Buzzingg﻿ getting mine on tuesday! :)
The﻿ beast has awaken.
Just there on the screen resides my ultimate love, and here with a throbbing sensation in my heart, i stare at her, cherish her beauty and fascinate what good times i could spend with her. Only to discover with the most dreadful, awful and heart drenching shock that﻿ she will never be mine!!!
If its garbage, im going dumpster﻿ diving!
Switchblade key...sexy﻿
wow a 2012 with a key start﻿ up......
I went in 2﻿ months and took all kinds of pics of this car before i left to go on vacation. Shes a beaut!!
Lamborghini is my﻿ fucking dream car !
ove the car, love the videos, keep up the great work Kyle! I﻿ just recently subscribed to the﻿ channel, you put in alotta good work bro! ..
I'd﻿ actually rather have this than the aventador
i was thinking about getting﻿ the ferrari 458 but the inside turned me off, so I'm getting this instead :)
This car is weird to me. I don't﻿ like the 458 Spider because I think a car that sophisticated and fast should have the stability of a true hard top. But I absolutely love this. Why? BECAUSE THIS THING IS SO FREAKIN INSANE LUNATIC IMPRACTICAL FANTASTIC
convertibles to me usually have a feminine look but this lambo looks﻿ fantastic and very aggressive i love it!!!
I love how﻿ when putting the top down, while the engine cover is dropping back in place the flaps on the roof look like batman ears. lol Awesome car.
I personally love the beeping lol. I Have no idea why﻿
I Am﻿ In Love With This Car Volkswagen And Lamborghini I Just Have To Say Good Job
I do too! Beautiful vehicle!﻿
this﻿ car is sexy sexy sexy!!
WTF is the center﻿ console made in CHINA ? POS. SUCH A BEAUTIFUL CAR FOR A FUCKED UP INTERIOR, EXCLUDING THE CARBON FIBER ;)
Too﻿ bad he didnt played "I'm sexy and I know it." That song would be good for this car..
Car looks﻿ nice, gauges are god awful :/
Such﻿ a beutifull vehicle
hell.... gets better mileage than my﻿ 1998 durango.
My life﻿ will be complete when I get my Lamborghini
lamborgini﻿ rifa
LOVE THE﻿ BATMAN POSITION!!!
LINKIN PARK AND LAMBO? MY DREAMS ARE COMINGO TRUE!!!﻿
I LOVE﻿ LAMBOS
this﻿ is my dream car
lamborghini gallardo﻿ is more beautiful than lamborghini aventador
Its a convertible,﻿ so it woudnt work. still a beautiful car
What a﻿ beautiful car.
i want one sooooo bad.....﻿
Very nice video & car, but I find﻿ the best sport car is the Audi R8
Carbon dash FTW!﻿
This is GODDESS!!﻿ NOT Diablo, NOT Murcelago, NOT Aventador,, but THIS!!!
i love v10 engine,it﻿ has awesome sound
398 lb torque? you would think it would have more, but i guess getting to 60 mph in 3.1 sec is good enough. ﻿
Personally I think this is the best﻿ of the pre dual clutch cars, and as I would never buy a new Lambo ever again due to poor customer support from the factory, buying a used one or two year version of this car, is great value for money and a hell of a great ride.
Yes,despite﻿ navi this car is great :))
Best looking car in the whole damn﻿ universe , endof story , GOODBYE
That's﻿ my dream car right there...
The radio﻿ is the engine :D
this type of lamborghini can be easily high jacked that aventador, will take forever﻿ to high jack it with state of the art igittion Idc about weight.
Anybody who listens to radio while driving﻿ these cars should have their licenses revoked.
everytime i hear a damn good car noise i (i really do..) get shiverings down my spine... in this video... i got them﻿ to... p.s. fuck my english
Astonishing sound!﻿
my all time favorite﻿ car
if you wouldnt dream for this car you are﻿ retarded
oh﻿ YEAH!! this car is so cool
Nice﻿ car
Compared﻿ to other lambos this looks somewhat practical.
My﻿ dream car that il never have
nice﻿ car
You know what i will just﻿ start off with this car i love the aventador but this is the first lamborghini you should ever get i love all lambos
Nice video u have the﻿ best car reviews
wow my dream car so going﻿ to get one
The center console and the e-brake is probably the most beautiful set up﻿ i've seen in a car.
If you've ever driven both ferrari and lamborghini you know this: women know it's﻿ a ferrari, but if they had to choose, they will get the lamborghini guy, simply because it's more attractive
MMMMMMMMM!!!! What a sexy car!!!!!﻿ MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMm!!!
What car do﻿ you drive? I bet it doesn't look as good as the Gallardo.
i love﻿ this lamborghini gallordo
My favorite car right﻿ now, the car i would buy if i had money, AWSOME SOUND
its actually alot more useful in cities than the aventador. it would clear alot more ramps than than its huge brother. and its alot more sexy in person﻿ than in pics/vids.
I personally prefer this to the Aventador, because you can have the top down. With﻿ me, i think that when Supercars loose the roof they only get better.
holy﻿ that sounds............
gallardos are﻿ the best cars ever
what a machine......damn﻿
The Dark Horse very Cool Vintage looking bike .﻿
Maybe overpriced but﻿ absolutely beautiful.
Beautiful﻿ bikes!
In fact﻿ it is a flagship bike, wonderful motorcycle.
Nice but very﻿ pricy. I hope Victory makes these so we all can have one if we so desire.
please dont let the design of victory influence indian old school look. Vintage is top seller for﻿ a reason people want that cool old school look. Also the stage 1 exhaust needs to be the pipe the motorcycle comes with the stock exhaust sucks period it chokes the bike and sounds like a sewing machine other than that they are the best bike in the world I owned a victory and now own a Harley and 2010 chief Darkhoese the Indian kicks all their asses no comparison monster bike plenty of power
The up side, these are amazingly awesome bikes! We were seriously interested in purchasing a chief vintage, but six Indian dealers nationwide . . .Yeah, I can see driving five hundred miles for service. Also, trying to get a reasonable test ride on a chief was worse than pulling teeth, so thanks again Indian for the wasted drive to the Chicago dealer, which﻿ is now closed.
They are very expensive, but I read that they focus on quality and exclusivity. I would love to﻿ ride one and see if its really worth the steep price. Beautiful bikes tho. Absolutely amazing looking. Have a nice day! ^^
cool bikes,,,,have indian on my cell myxer.com﻿ LiL LuLu﻿ has some of best indian ringtones,check it out & keep rideing
I currently have had the Korando last edition,the Kyron the Rexton I and now the Rexton II, also own two ugly stavic, but you know what, They are the﻿ best Suv's ever. i have driven over 6 metres over the andean roads thrashed Toyotas and Mitsubishis. All I can say ssangyong are the best Off-Roaders with the best Mercedes Turbo Diesel Engines and Mercede Gear Box, they may seem ugly but they beat the shit out of the japs and Americans in many ways excel a wrangler!!
Ohhh... poor Camry, and the worst/best thing is that the rexton didn't received too much damage, the driver should know that he is driving a 2.1 tons tank, but I love the SsangYong Rexton, because of things like this﻿ crash (I'm better driver and know my car), and Iv'e tuned most of it flaws (acceleration, suspension, brakes). It's a great car , and I'm happy with it. Also... Very fun video.
sweet head﻿ lights at 50
If you think this is good, you should see her live in concert. She took both my and my boyfriend's breath away. She's﻿ definitely the most talented and personable artist we've ever seen!
GM is getting better and better, I think they are getting﻿ it, just from the commercials, we can see GM is heading to a new direction!
The cars GM is turning out now and bringing out in the near future are what they should have been building for the last 15 years. It should make every American pround to know﻿ GM is putting the world on notice with its technology its performance and most of all its quality.
this commercial should﻿ only add to why you want to buy a GM. They make some of the best cars out on the world today. Yea they made some bad stuff in the 80's and 90's, but that was than. Everyone who thinks the cars GM makes are junk, they need to take a second look at GM and I am sure you will change you mind.
go﻿ GM!
hey, this is awsome i bought a 2002 chevrolet impala and its got more style﻿ than a ford. GM=Great Marketing
Makes me proud to be an American and to own GM﻿ vehicles!
I don't know why this commercial literally brought tears to my eyes. It made me so emotional that I began crying uncontrollably. It is the power of music combined with the beautiful cinematography and evocative imagery, I suppose. Like﻿ most of you, I love America and I love American culture. Our automotive heritage is part of our culture and we must treasure it. Don't you think?
You fucks talking shit about GM and American cars shouldn't call yourselves American... When you buy a GM vehicle your supporting over a million retirees and their families, but hey maybe its better for them to go to the soup line so you can drive your rice burner piece of﻿ shit.
This is a great Commercial. I agree they should not be bailed out without a plan. But As for the product,﻿ As a Dealer, I can vow for GM products. They Run and Run, in addition should they have a malfunction, the repairs are reasonable versus a VW, Toyota or Honda...GM has excellent products, when people ask me to look for a foreign car or truck, inside it hurts to hear that.
The Tahoe/Escalade is as good as any Foreign Truck. And WHY is HUMMER Treated like Sarah Palin? If you ever driven one you will see why this﻿ is one of the most versatile, comfortable and practical vehicles. Why doesn't some of the other highline cars that get crap MPGS get crap Hummer does? They can't even tow a mini trailer!
Gm is the best car company in the world. From Corvettes/camaros to work Silverados. Gm has a great car in﻿ every area.
FUCK YEAH GM!!!! proud GM owner: 2009 Malibu 2008 Acadia 2005 Corvette 1998 Grand Prix﻿ GTP
Good job. Some nice﻿ cars.
gm all the way﻿ lol cant wait to get my camaro painted sooooon
That's right. Nobody can make full-size SUVs, pick-up trucks and supercharged cars like GM.﻿
I own a 2000 Z24, 109,000 still runs like new and I won't trade her in until the Volt goes on sale... Although a red camaro convertible﻿ is very tempting LOL!
GM is the best auto maker in﻿ the world!!!!! Hands Down!!!
nice collection ther...... GM﻿ RULES!!!!!!
Makes me sad, General Motors has broken my heart for the last time. 1984 Chevy Silverado (Sold and still running) 1986 Chevy S-10 (Sold and still running) 1996﻿ Pontiac Grand Am (Traded in with a bad trans) 2002 GMC Sonoma (wrecked) 2006 Saturn Ion III (Deer collision) I loved my GM cars, even the Grand Am. But I can't stand where the brand is going, and what its' doing now. No one brand or company can replace them, but I can't help but realize that it's Time to walk away.
Say, darkskies 109, Americans don't walk away. We didn't walk away after Pearl Harbor. We didn't walk away at the beaches of Normandy. And GM didn't walk away when we needed it. So hang on because in American it only gest better. So, for the good of our country, may the best car win, and may the best car﻿ be an American car (GM, Ford or Chrysler).
The best car will always be, an American﻿ car
Man I﻿ love GM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When I first drove a car , I drove a 92 Chevy Caprice. And then my dad bought a 2002 chevy Caprice, and we used it. And then we " as a family " bought 2005 GMC Yukon XL. In 2009 , we bought a Chevy Tahoe.When I got my first Car, It was a 2011 Malibu. I left my country, and I'm looking for a car right now. - I went to the dealer, he﻿ told me that I should get the toyota camry. It's reliable and hold it's retail price, He said. I told him nothing is " worth " driving like GM. GIVE ME THE IMPALA!.
