The Koenigsegg Agera R can achieve it's﻿ top speed or close to it depending on tires with it's roof off, I think. The Veyron GS Vitesse is limited to 233 with it's roof off. So the Agera R is the fastest roadster in the world.
"What's better, than a Bugatti Veyron?" The﻿ McLaren F1. Need I say more?
@RacerPlanetZX1 The mclaren is a better all around car but the Bugatti is better on paper. And has more﻿ horse power.and a better top speed. Trust me I love mclaren but the facts are facts
is it just me? or does the dash look﻿ pretty dull and cheap?
The colour is horrid, I like flashy colours on﻿ supercars but this one doesn't tickle my fancy
it looks﻿ awful....
fuck Toyota﻿
Just like toyota thisz girl is a fake... just simply a meant﻿ 2 decieve people. Kinda how toyota looks like a good buy till u own it
Fat car for fat﻿ people!:):)
DA BACK IS KINDA UGLY I PREFER THE PREVIOUS SHAPE!!﻿ THUMBS UP
horrible... both﻿ the car and the driver!
definitely an X in﻿ the rear
can get a GR﻿ for 60k which would kill this car
As much as I﻿ love this car, It's probably the nicest way of saying this but it looks like it belongs in the car park of a Asda or iceland. Its a bit chavy and it looks cheap compared to the opposing Audi, BMW or Mercedes. Also for what you get, the price is for Mars and the styling has been done by someone either A: from Spanish decent or B: a communist.
Looks pretty good, but there is a different r8 I would﻿ rather have.
BMW M5 is better...﻿
i would consider it﻿ without that ugly body kit
Evo is a rally car This is﻿ an Australian muscle saloon designed for the bathurst, think before you comment next time so you don't get pwnd by anoraks like me,
everything about the car is nice except﻿ for the hideous psuedo front end grille
MUSTANG﻿ BOSS
Looks very cheezy, too﻿ cheezy. Too bad
Are all new﻿ Vauxhalls designed to appeal to chavs? Just looks cheap and will date very quickly.
@sikmeng of course! the C63 will be epic specially in that sexy matte paint but it will also be waaaay more﻿ expensive...
ugly as fuck, 1st﻿ gen was great
hideous... just plain awful looking﻿
It almost﻿ looks like they wanted to imitate the 2010 BMW 6 series kidney grills.
For gods sake, i still dont know why people dont understand this yet. Nobody EVER pays list price for any vauxhall EVER, especially the VXR8, with the old VXR8 people picked them up from the dealers at £25k, £10k under list price. Even with the Bathurst S they got them for £35k. It will﻿ be the same for this one
It﻿ is so ubulivable ugly I mean was the guy who styled this blind??
Another great Australian muscle﻿ car that doesn't get any appreciation over there. Yes it's a HOLDEN!
Another great Australian muscle car that doesn't get any appreciation﻿ over there. Yes it's a HOLDEN!
so﻿ ugly.and heavy.
Why did Holden further﻿ uglify this (otherwise) freaking awesome car???
wow, they really did a grrreeeeeeeeaat job with those wheels and rear bumper...﻿ looking good, lol..... that is ugly as shit!
0-60 in 5 seconds is not stunning today....actually just average for a sport sedan.﻿
Crap car for bogans, chavs and﻿ rednecks!
the rear looks﻿ so intimidating, the front however, fugly
The series one version of the﻿ car looks better than this but it is still a pretty good car!
loved the old one was so﻿ much fun
horribly expensive for a﻿ (very ugly) muscle car
To say that the rear end is hideous is an understatement.﻿
I prefer the standard Commodore rear﻿ lights
No supercharger in this version??﻿ That was the best part about the old one
Buy a 2011 Mustang for less. May have less features, but your hitting 60 in 4.6 sec. and handling is a little﻿ better.
thats a sick﻿ car. why isnt it in the u.s.?
You consider power slides as "handling"?? I was more referring to proper handling, EVO is a good handling car, VXR8 doesn't have anything on that in terms of﻿ handling.
but the VXR8 can't drift properly... a big﻿ pile of white smoke doesn't mean the car can drift properly. Comparing M3 and VXR8? are you joking!? The VXR8 is a very good car in it's own right, but handling isn't one of them.
Too much going on with the exterior of the car. I understand them not wanting to make the car look﻿ boring but come on? Does it need all of those hideous gills and vents? and those L.E.D's OH GAWD
com on man it's a vxr i can do that with my fj cruiser and btw i have a lumina ss with red interior and﻿ black exterior coupe and in my arab country a 5 year old can get the rear end out for fun it's pretty easy and btw the is f***king ugly and it sound like a tractor .....
Just buy a BMW M3!﻿
Did Europe﻿ get to see the beautiful looking HSV E series 1 before its two horrible looking successors?
I would admit,﻿ the colour is not that good. But the car as a whole is fucken awesome...'I Just Want One!'
Yes but BMW is a high quality car, it's not just﻿ a big engine and cheap plastics!
The previous one was way nicer than this﻿ one!!!
it looks﻿ like a bulkier looking evo.
fake r8﻿ lol
an EVO would destroy﻿ this while costing so much less
With the Australian $ so﻿ high now no wonder its expensive, silly car for most of us in Europe given the cost of fuel... OK back in Australia where its half the price.
Vauxhal loves chavvy styling, the previous astra looked great but when they took the VXR out they just totaly chavved﻿ it up
thats so﻿ damn expensive. id pay the extra money and drive around in a benz than a yellow thing that will age in no time. so over done with all the body kit,
It's just not gonna get anywhere this car, just costs too much. Getting close to an M3 with that price. If it was considerably cheaper than an M3 then maybe people would go for this instead, and it would become alot more popular. Could be a competitor for the evo and scooby, with a few changes. But its just not gonna happen with that sky-high price tag. Shame﻿ actually, doesnt look too bad
it looks like some guy﻿ tuned a G8...not very nice estetics....
It looks it's designed by﻿ Hotwheels
The body styling is even worse than the older model... Holden really needs﻿ to work on it..
All Australians agree.﻿ It's ugly, used to be a top looking car.
Funny how he questions the price tag (50k)﻿ & wonders why anyone would buy it when they can get a C63 (60k), or an M5 (70k). Then talks about if it had a supercharger, combined with that chassis, it would be fantastic. Well, you're saving 10k if you were going to buy the Merc, or 20k if the M5 was an option. Supercharger kits do not cost 10k (pounds, remember, not dollars). So, you'll have spent less than a C63 or M5 owner & will towel them both all day every day.
How can GM cars do so poorly on power figures? The VXR8 produces only 10hp﻿ more than an M3 and the VXR8 has over 50% more displacement...shameful
@determinedskeptic cost a third of the price of﻿ an m5, half an m3 or c63 and around the same as an audi a4 2.0 TFSI in Australia. Not sure why its so expensive in Britain, probably the high australian dollar
why﻿ get this when you get get a EVO
Actually, Mr Clarkson did not cause the demise of Rover. Rover did﻿ that for themselves. BMW gave the Phoenix Consortium almost £1bn to develop new cars. What did they do? Give themselves pay rises and spend 20p on giving the cars new shaped headlights and a shiny grille.
Alfa﻿ 164 lol
mg is da best aint ad nank to beat me yet!﻿
If you bought a Rover 800 you're asking for flipping trouble!! Crap cars - helped killed Rover. The Rover 75 was the ONLY decent car that the modern day Rover produced. Dont try and compare it to the 800﻿ rubbish... anyone who bought one of those knows NOTHING about cars...
The Rover 800 helped destroy Rover with its unreliability! True enough - if you dont like retro-styling - which the 75 has﻿ - stay away from the 75.... but at least it HAS style!
Your 75 yr old neighbour﻿ obviously has taste... you could learn from him/her. Anyway good luck with your '800' - you're gonna need it!
The MK2 800 was a good car and to be honest fixed alot of the problem with the MK1. The 75 is a good car but it's no 800, and yes it was out dated from it's launch just like the 600. The 800 was never out dated except for it's handerling. The 2.0 was the best in class, space was no Grandada beater but it had more then﻿ enough. Even ride and handerling was good till 96 when others moved the game on.
My dad has this car, an 820Si Automatic, and it goes just as well as it did when he bought it, waaaay back in June 1995...yes it had some problems but, to be true, all the cars suffer when age goes on, and especially the newest cars (from 2002 onwards), which are full of electrics, are even more unreliable than the Rover 800 OR, at Least, equal...we aren't looking forward to get rid of the 820, we're gonna keep it as long as it is able﻿ to move!!! Besides, it's a joy to ride, and very beautiful!!
I sold my Rover 75 couple months ago - and taken up on the theory "if you cant beat 'em -join 'em!" and bought a brand new BMW 7 Series! - oh﻿ well....!
In the engine bay theres a box on the passenger side. It contains three (sometimes four) relays. Once the engine started it was fine. Then one relay would start flickering, the engine would start to splutter﻿ and it'd die. It was probably a problem with the EMU, but we never found out. Although I have seen the car since driving around perfectly. But the current owner has disgraced the car by putting a tow-bar on it :(
Yeah I know. I want my first car to be a Rover 820. But the insurance is alot more exspensive on the 820 than it is on the Rover 75. Which is weird but oh well﻿ lol
Me dad had one. Hated﻿ it lol
One of the best cars ever made, especially the 2.7. Lacked tourque!!! No Way, that's one of the reasons the police used them. Modern cars just don't﻿ cut it any more. They are disposable, characterless and a sea of plastic.
Rover﻿ R.I.P
Rover ﻿ R.I.P
I think Rover would've﻿ been fine if they had kept the deal with Honda.
there is not much technology is there now No Sat Nav﻿ or anything
Ye, well, Honda Accord or Toyota Avensis are still better cars,﻿ especially in terms of interior quality, which is where you spend 99% of the time, AND, they cost less. Mazda 6 is more expensive that rivals like Honda Accord, Opel / Vauxhall Insignia, Renault Laguna, Ford Mondeo etc, and its not really better than any of those.
An﻿ ugly car that's massively overpriced.
if it costs less than £4k, ide﻿ buy one...
what a "great" golf﻿ cart....
Α quadricycle﻿ perhaps... Not a car!
seriously, if some one wants a﻿ fun city car without doors you would be better off buying a Caterham 7
a geek and his over﻿ priced electric golf cart...
and the worst car﻿ ever award goes to...
I really dont understand cars like this. When is the car industry gonna realize that electricity just ISNT the answer without some HUGE improvements in battery technologuy. Who wants a car that halfs in range when its cold outside and halfs again when you put the lights on. Better focus on either battery﻿ research or improving hydrogen or fuel cells id say...
This car is﻿ so gay.
that's one overpriced golf kart﻿
It's not even﻿ a car, it's just a toy.
I only have one question: what if it rains? Right, this car is﻿ shit.
think ill just buy﻿ a bike..
for the city roads?﻿ Nah!!! Replace golf buggies with this then Yea!!!
make﻿ it longer with more room for second passenger, then I would buy it.
Front: Looks like a beer-bellied man with protruding tits Back: Fat ass Now﻿ I know who the market segments are meant for...
The front﻿ looks like a monkey's face.
Noddy would be embarrassed to be seen﻿ in that.
They should make﻿ it look more sporty and cooler, very good idea though.
too﻿ expensive
I would literally take a shit on this﻿ car if i seen it out in public. This thing is trash.
People that drive this car must have had a rough﻿ childhood. Lmao
What﻿ if you want to look back? stupid,
handicap four-wheel motorcycle ﻿
don't think i'd be able to drive that being﻿ 6'4" .. O_o
a﻿ great car ... ... for a golf course.
Very good for a city like Paris﻿ ... just put doors x)
No, if Americans didn't spend money they don't have on useless shit like this car﻿ then we wouldn't be in crisis..
Making these cars small is dumb,﻿ they should have normal mid sized car dimensions for safety. You need some crush area......I can see how to build a light weight full efficient car with mid-sized detentions, why cant they....oh yeah the car designers are idiot children of other idiot car designers of the past. All the people that should be designing these cars OBVIOUSLY shouldn't be designing cars...Oh well, born into a career is the way of the world, idiot or not ur daddy makes you.
as﻿ soon as it comes out ill just go and steal one ... no dors WTF??!!
put some﻿ fucking doors on it!
It's a good conceptual car, but as an actual daily﻿ road car, it's not very good or practical.
you're an idiot. its not classified as﻿ a car you dumb mother fucker. lol motorcycle, front crash test/side crash test = DEATH. dumbass..
would be good...﻿ for a kid! lol
Half a star Euro﻿ NCAP rating?
The only way to make this shit-mobile worse is to install square﻿ wheels : /
I﻿ would need doors to use it here in Montreal. Apart from that I like it a lot.
Had to﻿ go and watch the Aventador video again after watching this!
It look likes one of those cars used﻿ by fat americans to go to the supermarket....But with a roof. Complete RUBBISH. AND...it's french. DOUBLE RUBBISH!!!
what if you get into an accident vs﻿ SUV? i don't want my shoulders to be the crumple zone. this "car" is not even close to be done
any American who drives one of these has no friends, no life, and no﻿ girlfriend. No Americans drive this. Ever.
oh yea renault they went from﻿ v10 1,000bhp championship winning formula 1 cars (2005 and 06) to.............this ugly thing(2011) -__-
What if you get﻿ in an accident with a truck?
and if﻿ you t-boned? you are fucked. this EV bull needs to stop. its useless and impractical.
Nice thing but there's a smart electric﻿ coming too, i much rather would have that if i have got to choose
just use﻿ a scooter! faster, longer range, smaller and more fun!
wouldn't call this a car. my lawnmower can go faster ﻿
Id﻿ rather a can am to be honest!
it is an open car because﻿ it is a french car. would you rather chance rain or be stuck in a closed car with a smelly frenchman?
obviously stay dry﻿ and be warm...
As someone from Australia, I don't see﻿ how this car will be popular over here in foreseeable future.
well here in america after that osama﻿ bin laden thing gas is going to SKYROCKET, so i'm guessing formula 1 in the future would be electric to? :'(
Twizy sounds like an English﻿ obscenity...
Why do﻿ they make them so ugly?
I think the design﻿ is pretty cool, but at least throw some light weight doors on it for rain purposes
It's not about getting wet, it's about﻿ losing your dignity. :x
same goes for Amsterdam. Plus you prob﻿ need to lock it TO something, otherwise people will throw it into a canal here
call to ban for older people ( 75 to 100 years old ) on this Twizy. Noway It is dangerous. But okay for young to middle ages. Any older people should be suit any electirc wheelchairs, NOT﻿ TWIZY.
make it petrol﻿ and add doors and ill buy it.
Um...﻿ no. Europeans should leave the Japanese to making micro/kei cars.
7000 for that are you shitting me? looks like﻿ a total ripoff
It´s french, it´s electric and....wait for it..... IT´S UGLY!!!!! So why would you ever﻿ buy one?
can you make it V8 and not﻿ look so pathetic? no wait...i need an atom
Why﻿ would I want storage space if it doesn't have any doors?
Rather﻿ have the Tango
so gay﻿ !
I've﻿ always wanted a golf cart I could drive on the street...
it really﻿ needs doors.
This video loads as slow as the speed of﻿ this car.
i﻿ want to blow this ugly car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'd rather have﻿ a G-Wiz.
renault SHITTY ﻿ not twizy
looks more modest, wished﻿ it still had the silver wheels though :p
It's ugly cars like this why people stay away﻿ from electric vehicles .
it's not an electric﻿ car...... it's an electric joke
you're right, and﻿ then this is more a scooter than a car, wtf!
It doesn't have﻿ doors?
Surely an﻿ electric smart car will be much more practical? 1+1 seating and no doors just makes this a rubbish golf cart if you ask me.
I guess the biggest question is whether this will fit between lanes of﻿ traffic? 1m width, not sure...
I can't see this car standing up and surviving in the tough city of london, the stupid apron wont protect you from splashes coming off lorries, that shit is like﻿ fog with a mass and weight, and what happens when winter comes? and the car is covered? what your meant to spend 4 hours cleaning snow from inside the car?
that car is a failure. everybody would choose﻿ a good ole gas guzzling jeep over this anyday
£7,000 and £50 per month?! For that price you could get an actual car (e.g. a VW Fox, a Peugot 107 or﻿ a Chevrolet Spark).
I﻿ love the concept of this car but I think it's too expensive... maybe the 2nd or 3rd generation will be more realistic with the price.... Moreover... for that price they *must* add some real doors so you can lock it properly when you park....
WOW it's just like someones mobility scooter except you're﻿ paying 7 times the price for a fancy roof.
No thanks, I would rather have a Smart fortwo which have doors, 2 full sized seats and a decent﻿ boot for the same price.
I couldnt believe when someone said to me there's﻿ a car that is worse than smart fortwo. Sorry my friend
Where are﻿ the doors?
If this had dors and windows﻿ I would buy it without question. As it is, the Norwegian winter will not be cool(pun intended) :p
IT's CHEAP !!! VERY﻿ CHEAP !!!!
the concept car for﻿ the twizy was so much more better looking than this! cmon frenchies build it properly!
Yeah you're right electric cars wouldn't suit areas like yours, they're more so made for big European cities like Rome, Paris, Berlin etc. I live in Ireland and I wouldn't see any use for it here either though, our roads are narrow, but quite long and our main cities like Dublin, Galway and Cork are too﻿ small to even bother using city cars like this. It seems to be a very hit and miss car really :L
what about theft i would like﻿ to see this parked in swansea it wont be there for long and also who going to pay out 7K the 50 quid a month i certainly wouldn't,
Yes I agree, the kids in my street would play in it all the time, put some doors on the stupid﻿ thing! £7000 err I'd rather buy a second hand smart or 207 ... Le merd
I never said that they do, I was just pointing out some of the areas that they would﻿ suit and wouldn't suit! I hate electric cars, there's only one type of engine that could outdo the combustion engine and it's years from doing so, the hydrogen engine.
epic fail anyone would take﻿ a good old gas guzzling land rover discovery over this any day
4 to 9K € ... tyvm but you can﻿ build a bad ass bycicle for that gold and have much more enviromental friendly fun
whats the﻿ difference to a golf kart?
"solar panel as big as your house" - Only if that were the only source, and if the car was needed for daily work commute. I had a more leisurely application in mind "use no﻿ less energy" - I never suggested otherwise "will polute the enviro MORE" - Only if you﻿ dump them. Power stations R intrinsically cleaner than roving IC engines "a fuel cell" - Have U seen their price? It's the noble metals... "high efficiency gas turbine" - An oxymoron. No such ting "weight/energy" - Check LIPOs
I live in tenerife and I was wondering how would this﻿ thing handle in an area with so many mountains and hills. And with no doors? C'mon! It reminds me of the BMW c1... Not worth it.
How can u use this car when it rains?﻿ Lol
I'm all for electric cars and﻿ I think this is great... But it NEEDS doors. Not practical in rain.
And if someone crash your Renault Twizy (with you),﻿ don't worry, you have no possibility to survive.
Proof? This is Renault we're talking about. And Smart, years ago made their ForTwo a 5 star EuroNCap car because it used a high strength cage that could protect the occupants in a collision with a C Class. Renault obviously has one, they said it and the ''car'' weighs 450kg, the batter is 100kg.﻿ BUT a side impact would scare and fuck me sideways.
I like but what would happen, let say,﻿ if starts raining?
its﻿ cool for city driving but thats it.
really who would buy this? its so expensive﻿ for a car that has no doors or anything and can only fit 2 people even without a trunk.
where the fuck are﻿ the doors??
Lease for the battery, they got to be fucking joking, fuck me there taking the piss, what a﻿ pease of shit.
Fuck me i bet﻿ they will be trying to sell dead camels to Arabs next, stuped fuckwitts.
As we switch over to electric cars watch the price﻿ of electricity go through the roof as the grid struggles to cope with demand, instead of building more power stations they will put the price up so the masses/poorer people are forced to use less which will increase fuel poverty﻿ especialy for are poor pensioners, another reason why the poor in the uk will get pooorer....
souped﻿ up disability scooter
it looks very bad I doubt that it will sell good.... and for 7k pounds......... reminds me the small cars for people with no driving license.... I think it will be a big commercial failure. but even﻿ being so negative about it I would love to try one!
they forgot the bloody doors what a pile o﻿ shit
I just can not see a market for it. You're open to the elements like a bike or scooter, but you do not have the same filtering possibilities so it has the disadvantages of a bike, cold, wet (with a﻿ side wind) no where to leave anything and the disadvantages of a car in traffic. It's actually a step backwards from Noel Edmonds Qpod in my opinion!
i only put about £40 a month in my suzuki or £5 a month in my ped ﻿ at the moment with this i will be paying 40 to 50 just for lease of the bats then you have to charge it and there no where to charge it in town yet not worth the effort . shame like the thing
That's pretty cool﻿ :D Too bad something like that would be illegal and too slow in the states.
It's a quad bike with a roof,and no engine.where do you put luggage?where do you put anything?christ i could'nt even get myself in that!!!!!! Does it take AAA's or do you pull it back and let go?i hate to think about the result of a collision with a normal vehicle.totally impractical and ugly as﻿ sin.
I want to see a﻿ serious electric car, please
that is not a fucking car. that is a golf cart. i'm sorry. I can deal with the smart car..﻿ and the iq but seriously that has to be the biggest example of electric powered bullshit on wheels that i;ve seen
I like the basic concept and design and am very tempted. However without doors it is, in practical terms, a no,no. Some years ago I had﻿ a Mini Moke with a roof, but no doors, which meant that when it rained I was soaked in quick time.
See I like it and would drive around town in it. If everyone else did. If not you're just asking to﻿ die.
i think it can not sell in cold﻿ area....
I think﻿ it will need rain jacket to go with it.
7k for that shit? nty.﻿
oh, it doesn't have﻿ doors? is easier to steal then
Needs doors﻿
Cool! Now it just needs doors,﻿ a heater and an onboard generator..
Three companies﻿ are already selling real electric cars there's the Nissan leaf,Chevy Volt,and Tesla S. Well the Volt is actually a hybrid but the it can be used in pure electric mode. Which is why I find﻿ it odd that Renault is hawking a glorified golf cart thing.
it will be amazing to see these hit the cities and towns, i would get one myself maybe in a few years, but i wouldnt like to drive this with much larger cars and trucks around you still running off fuel. if streets where covered in these little twizy cars and other fully electric cars﻿ it would make such a difference to the environment and would make driving so much safer it would be unreal. Damn i love technology
twizy﻿ need something to put a big bag behind , a back or something
A version with a small diesel engine and more performance would be nice. ﻿
The﻿ minigolf future car ._.
dont have doors?! o.o motherofgod ﻿
I would prefer to buy an electric quad than a miniature﻿ car....
afcorse it﻿ handles good in corners it goes only 45 :S
this thing looks so ugly﻿ :D
Thats all well and good when you're at home if thats the case. I'm talking about being able to charge the car whilst you're out and about, hence me saying that there isn't any charging posts in the city I live in. There needs to be more investment in the national infrastructure so that﻿ people can charge their cars when they're out and about too!
I have seen this one at our local Renault seller. I﻿ like it, but it has no side windows! (don't like that!) The price is around 10000Euros, the battery is on leasing. I think it has a chance!
It needs two seats﻿
During﻿ winter?
seriously dont put this thing on the roads, its ugly and looks﻿ like one of those kid's amusement shopping carts at ikea
How is this car more cost effective for the petrol car driver around town that it is aimed at. Someone who just drives around town might over the month spend £100 on fuel (even with current prices). This buggy is going to cost £60 a month battery rental and then when you add on electricity costs for charging it up people will ask "What am I saving moving to electricity?".﻿ For such little savings I'd rather have something larger to sit in which moves faster and can have extra storage in.
degenerative braking?﻿ does that mean that the brakes get worse as the battery drains?? If this is true, why even make a car like that??
By the looks of this vehicle, don't think it is gonna be a success on Uk roads, and not much in way of protection against collissions with other vehicles, looks﻿ different but is slow and too small, not a fan sorry, try again Renault.
aaaaahahahaha what a piece of shit xD why﻿ would u want to be seen in﻿ that??
this is a car﻿ for stupids nerds......
I'm sure you'll feel as safe as houses dodging the HGvs and﻿ Buses....also a heavy rain shower in traffic will be great fun....
lol its﻿ just a mobility scooter with a roof
that is the most funniest looking car ever. it's also the shittiest in my﻿ opinion.
WHERE﻿ ARE THE DOORS?
I drove this car today - brilliant, so much fun and practical! Only down point - the doors. The standard model comes without ANY doors. You pay £545 for a half a door. The top of the door were you would expect a window to be is empty. Not suited to british weather, but barr this I think a good buy. 90p to charge it from empty to full, no road tax, £240 insurance, big savings﻿ to be had!
Wouldn't be seen dead﻿ in one.
On of the ugliest cars on the market right﻿ now.
£7000 -_- ﻿
7000 is just too much﻿ for such a tiny car
SHIT CAR!!!!!!! ﻿
it's better the﻿ steven hawking wheelchair!!!!
Why are they calling this a car? Even﻿ by golf cart standards thing sucks. Notice that the gov has to pay for half of it with your tax dollars so it has even a small chance of being viable.
I think it's funny that the best thing they﻿ could say about this "car" is it's fun to drive. Bumper cars are fun to drive but it desn't mean I want to drop my kid off at school in one.
I....I....just...dude wtf!? It just looks like a really fancy golf cart. It this some twisted insanity test for mankind, to just pluck out all﻿ the people who buy this atrocity?
This car? is bullshit. A﻿ glamorized golf cart for retirement communities. I want to hit the gas and go on long trips. No thanx to the Twitzy!.
Can someone please explain how this type of EV will work in our UK winters. How will owners defrost the windscreen?Will it be a case of deicer and a scraper? and more importantly, keep the screen clear on﻿ cold days?
I would buy this car but i live in the states and all the people with the hummers and chevys﻿ will mock me.Although you know what they say about people with small cars ;)
it's a freaking wheelchair...﻿
COOOOOOOOL! Could do with a pair of doors. I mean with the state of britain these days I wouldn't feel safe leaving the thing﻿ on the pavement!
My neighbour has just got﻿ one. What a wanker lol
So﻿ by definition, people with small cars...
does anyone know how long it will be before all cars are electric? because I﻿ like electricity as an option, but i also love gasoline cars.
Doors are 700 quid option, even then they're not full doors (no windows). no heater either. that'll be fun on a cold winters commute. range is then cut by cold weather as well. to as little as 45miles. oh, & the final nail in your coffin is that you have to rent the battery from Renault at 45 quid a month. think they'll sell many? nah me neither.﻿
@ GhurkaGangProduction﻿ Ha! If someone had one of these in the US, it would get stolen in a bloody heart beat!
the no window option is bizarre, maybe it's because the cabin is so small, that people inside might suffocate after a while for lack of oxygen if it hand windows :P There are people who'll buy something like this, if it can get approved to drive on bus lines like motorbikes it can be a viable option. There's an american car of this category that is treated like a motorcycle﻿ and therefore allowed to ride paralell with other bikes in the same lane, also drive inbetween lanes.
CREATIVE CAR BUT A RIP OFF DEAL!!! 1. Yes it's eye catching, inexpensive but did you know that you can own the whole car but not the battery? I didn't know that until I went to buy the damn thing Daaaaah it's like buying a car without the engine. What good is a hybrid car for without batteries? You have to lease it &﻿ it's 55 pounds per month FOR LIFE. So you'll keep paying that for as long as you own it. 2. Insurance is the biggest kicker, I phoned the insurance company that Renault deals w
I just got the insurance quote yesterday in the mail & it's 2,761 pounds for a TWIZY!!! Means in a little more than two years you will end up paying more than what﻿ the car is actually worth﻿ just for insurance. Is this a joke?? 2k over this grocery store trolly??
Also in 2 years your battery lease bill will reach some where around 1,320 pounds .... Oh & I forgot to mention one more thing about this car, you can't use the public electric stations around the city to charge it as the plug is different and you can't get an adaptor for it either. So if you are doing 60 mph you will drain the battery in 10 min & good﻿ luck finding someone to tow it in a rainy day﻿
great car, good job we NEVER have rain in the UK... Oh, crap... wait..... the phrase "as much use as a chocolate fireguard" comes to mind would it not﻿ be better to buy a mobility scooter instead.
I like the look﻿ of this but loaning the battery just sounds like a con
£50 a month to lease the battery? i﻿ spend less than that on fuel for my 125 cc bike! for a non poluting vehical the running cost should be cheaper to run than a petrol vehical. the sales will poor for sure.
Its a fukin four wheeler﻿ for an american. 60miles that sucks 7000lb you tripping
Compressed natural gas? Well i would not be able to use it at all seeing as there﻿ is no where within 100 miles of me to fill it up. I would really like an electric car, but they just are not quite there with the range, cost and performance yet :(
£7000, not 7000lb, 7000lb would be silly £7000 is about $11,000. not exactly great value considering what other cars you could buy for﻿ the money.
Yes its a real fun car to drive especialy when you park it up for the night and come back in the morning and find some f---ers have trashed the inside, well i no what i would rather spend﻿ seven grand on, a nice one owner secondhand Mercedes S L 500 that come standard with doors.
Its a clever idea but i would not want one it looks nice and safe on the crash tests but it probably would not stand a chance if a normal car hit it. we have not seen an accident yet but just wait the law is changing in the uk but i am glad to hear that with new rules from next year a 16 year old will need to do the full theory test & , CBT and another form of testing.﻿ but the big things are the insurance its not going to be cheap.
Das war wohl nichts. Go back to the drawing board.﻿ What a joke!!
It would be nice if﻿ they would not make electric cars look so stupid.
Its a load of shit ! ﻿
if they are going to make cars so fucking narrow they should at least design it to lean into turns like a motorcycle so it doesn't roll over like a fucking Reliant Robin.﻿
Not having doors really produces a lot of aerodynamic drag. Some type of enclosed fairing would﻿ help with battery life. Also, those mirrors produce a lot of drag. They should be replaced with two small camera lenses at the rear connected to a display on the dash.
I want one! In Australia! But I would like a small trailer to hook on the back that contains a small petrol or diesel generator that can charge the car while driving to extend the range as long as the﻿ fuel tank is topped up. Sort of a hybrid option.
Now they offer windows as well for another 250 Euros, which you can supposedly assemble yourself. Now you can drive it in the winter too! :-D I love this pretty little thing!! But they shouldn't make people rent﻿ the battery, that's just a rip-off...and they should offer prettier patterns and colours, too, like flowers or rainbows and stuff.
crap,gimmicky and won't catch on. what the hell were renault﻿ thinking.
I miss the XJS-HE and XKE styling...﻿
M5﻿ any day... you cant even get a manual in the jag :(
its like sitting on﻿ a fat dog????
Manual or not,﻿ a BMW M5 is just such an awesome car. Jaguar did a truly awesome job with this one, but the M5 is more my style.
SURE BMW !! ﻿
like every﻿ jaquar earlier a car for the 50/60+ generation ... definitely bmw!!
Theres waaayyy too much bias here. Ive had the pleasure of driving﻿ both and the jag is good, but its not as good the M5. The turn in is really slow and you have to get on the power really late when you exit a corner. Also, those fancy rotating AC units? They get stuck from time to time.
the front end of﻿ that Jag looks too much like a shitty Chrysler
who the fuck﻿ sits on a fat dog?
I'd﻿ choose BMW
but the﻿ jag is fugly
I'd still get the M5 any day.﻿
i rather get﻿ the new gtr for that type of money
A BMW fan will always be a BMW fan so i would take the other option, but it's a thing﻿ of taste.
i like the m5's﻿ grill more than this one
CTS-V will still blow the doors off for less than 60,000 pounds, and it looks better, and you can get them﻿ with a manual gearbox. Yeah, I'll take it.
Well you clearly are biased towards a British Car.﻿ German Engineering is was better. BMW M5 is clearly way better :)
The 5 series is many things. Spacious is not one of them. That interior is﻿ as cramped as can be. Fun as hell though1 =D
I love this show but the Brits are so biased when it comes to their cars. I owned an XJ8 and a 2004 Range Rover and my experience with both was terrible. Other than great comfort, both were the most unreliable automobiles I have ever﻿ owned. I am now a proud owner of a 2008 Mercedes S320 CDI 4matic and a 2006 Toyota Landcruiser 120 Series and let me tell you the German and Japanese engineering are MILES ahead of the British. Sorry Brits you do very comfortable cars but are very unreliable.
the jag could be 1000 times more cheap or powerful﻿ AND i would still buy the M5.
M5 for﻿ me please!
I'd take almost any Audi, any day. Don't tell me the S5, RS4 or RS6 aren't 10 times﻿ more delicious
But aren't those both American cars? I also hear that the Land Rovers are giant piles. My buddy told me﻿ the body of his Range Rover (2007) separated from the frame! Holy crap! I personally like BMW.
Actually, I'm Bulgarian. :) As for the put downs, I see it both ways with Brits always putting Americans down as well. I have seen a Range Rover get to the top of the mountain, mine did it all the time.﻿ My Land Cruiser does it just as well, but doesn't break down while doing it. Again with my old XJ8, yes my legs did shake from its beauty but its unreliability made them shake as well, unlike my S-class which makes my legs shake from its beauty, reliability and amazing technology.
The Jaguar has﻿ so much torque that it tore a hole in time and became like every other jaguar: outdated, backward and inferior to the BMW.
What﻿ a stupid statement... E class beats the m5 in every way...
the bmw has a plate with xfr on it﻿
BMW RULLZ﻿ BITCH!
I love bmw's, I think they are almost perfect and never liked the idea of a Jaguar... ...but I﻿ love this car.... the noise, the v8 grunt, beautiful...
i﻿ i would take the m5
I like the M5, it's German﻿ :D, and reliable.
good﻿ cuz I hate show offs (aka bmw)
haha what a question!! BMW or﻿ Jaguar....its like asking: cake or death???
id rather have a toyota then a﻿ jag
Move over Jag, Cadillac coming﻿ through.
A turboed ford V8.....english cars are shit....always have been.....why does﻿ Jeremy pull his dick over them?
I would get the M5 but the Jag is also﻿ good.
awsome﻿ car, but i prefer the Mercedes E63 AMG.
cool car, but it was still rated for dependability at 143% below average, in other words it's a peice of﻿ shit and always breaks down
I'll still take the﻿ second fastest 4-door on the nurburgring.... CTS-V.
m5﻿ fo life
you can not compare bmw is NASA for jaguar﻿
don't forget that it still is a saloon with a front engine... it's fast﻿ in a straight line but "struggles" to be as sharp as sportscars such as ferrari, porsche etc through corners...
M5 <3 ﻿
I'd still rather have the wonderful, high-revving, normally aspirated M5. Only with﻿ a six speed stick. No auto for me.
It does look﻿ like shit. Jaguar needs a new design team.
as a HUGE FAN OF BMW, I GOT TO SAY THIS CAR IS AMAZING﻿ !
Get the CTS-V﻿
What cock are﻿ you sucking? Jags are just slightly less good looking than Aston Martins
M5﻿ FOR EVER
As much﻿ as I respect Clarkson's opinion, a BMW is better than a Tata
bad time to show that Jag...the new M5 is going to have over 580 bhp.....talk about having +80 torques huh?﻿
the new BMW 5 series is ugly as shit. The one in this video is much better looking.﻿ BMW have taken a step backwards.
bmw owns!!!bmw for﻿ life!
2010 mercedes e63 kills﻿ both
m5 looks better so... ﻿
laawl... comparing this﻿ car to an M5 is like.. comparing a 50's Ford to a Ferrari... come on...
and damn proud of :P﻿ so what? lol you seen the video.. M5 kicked Jaguar's ass big time
the m5 is a 6 year old car and yet it still beats a Jaguar.﻿ the next m5 will crush the Jag.
When did Jeremy begin loving BMW? WTF I'm very proud of him however! He's come to the right side﻿ :)
both of them were slower than the E63﻿ AMG round the track.
Too bad this car is not very waterproof. Normally, when I drive through a local swamp for a shortcut, the water gets﻿ in the car during seasonal floods when I have to drive a car completely under water for short periods of time. I hope they will fix that problem later on.
Good idea. However, the problem with both of these cars is that it's very hard to attach a jetpack to﻿ them so normally I have to use a crane to park my car on top of a roof. Also, I don't know about noise reduction. Normally, when you're driving through a library with a 4x4, you'll disturb readers with your car noise but in Jaguar XFR, you can modify your car so that it makes so little noise, that now everyday driving through libraries won't disturb anyone..
but ,﻿ the shape of the jaguar is not so cool .. the BMW M5 has its lovely body shape and really good :P
Too bad it's﻿ a Ford lol
My dad looked﻿ into getting one of these, but instead he got the 2009 BMW M5 because apparently it is better than the Jaguar.
The Maserati is﻿ sketch, it's just a fancy, exclusive, good-looking Italian car. It's not as fast and does not have half the features of the Mercedes (even the S63). Unless you get it in black, it's a woman's car in my opinion. If you want refined European luxury in the same range as Maserati, you should opt for an Aston Martin Rapide instead, though it's quite a bit more expensive. Italians should stick to exotics (which are absolutely breath-taking), and not luxury sedans.
jag RELIABILITY? I know a friend who owns one, and the dealership had to replace the engine. ﻿ Rather than getting bad press, the dealership did it for free. So I'm not confident of the reliability down the road...
@Jaguar:4 the love og God PLEASE re-design the headlighs when the mid-life,facelifted model comes out!﻿ It looks GREAT from 3 angles.......
' no thank,,, i dont need this fantasy car,,, what happen have a big accident someday﻿
Either way it's﻿ shit... Indian or American
the m5 is a 507 bhp monster sedan but to me its so .................ugly.The only thing that pleases me with the m5 is﻿ that it has a v10
Jaguar﻿ has cracked it again. This is and was THEIR formula over the decennia and what a ''Jaaag'' is all about: Stylish Comfortable Going like the bloody clappers.
xfr﻿ really is like sitting on a fat dog
M5 is better﻿ any day
m5 over jag﻿ any day.
My m8﻿ has had two BMWs - both had their turbos fail at just over 70,000miles - he drive Mercedes now.
m5 has a naturally aspirated engine v10, jag has﻿ supercharged v8. i don't like the way jag looks both interior and exterior. Other than that they seem to be on par, except m5 maybe tiny bit better.
XFR better than M5 ... r u﻿ kidding?
I love the Jag only problem is that it isn't british... anymore its owned by﻿ tata motors an Indian company
It's uncannily comfortable... unless you're sitting in the back seat. My buddy has an XF and it truly is a beautiful thing, but if I wanted a two seater...﻿ Why doesn't Jag actually make the rear seat comfortable?
I'm not British and I absolutely love Jaguar. BMW is a world class car but it doesn't have the soul of Jaguar. I only wish that Ford hadn't sold them to Tata. Some wealthy Brit needs to buy them back before Tata moves production to India or China. The current﻿ Jaguars were designed during the Ford days, there is no telling what might happen now.
You gotta love that foolish British chauvenism of Top Gear.﻿ Bottom line is: British cars stink, German cars rule. BMWs have been and will always be superior to Jaguars. Nothing that Britain or even America can come up with can come close to challenging the superior craftsmanship of German luxury sedans. It seems that the English speaking world had simply become fat and lazy after WWII, and the Germans are once again taking over Europe. Lebe lang Deutschland!
This may very well be a well planned car, but the front end looks like a Chrysler Sebring, which is a major turn off. Especially the grille! Where's the flair for such﻿ a car?
I don't like its front, looks a bit like Korean﻿ type of cars!
jaguar blandest car on the inside my god how can he like that bs over the m5 with a﻿ str8 face. LETS SEE THE BBC REVIEW CTV V!
i'd prefer the jaguar on this but thats also because i generally dont﻿ like BMW's styling outside and inside.
The Jaguar has﻿ one of the world's best looking contour, better than the stupid looking old M5, though it has improved on the new one. The XF and the XJ. What baffled me is why Jag even bothered to release a racing version. Race it, you'll never beat M Series.
Votes for BMW M5!﻿
Wow. jag﻿ needs a supercharger where the M5 is NATURALLY ASPIRATED. soft
BMW is a better car, but the Jag is a JAAAAG﻿
BMW handles better and is accelerates faster as shown in the video, until a point it hits the limiter. It is cheaper, but I don't﻿ really care about that. I would get the Jag though, but the new M5..that would trash the Jag, and between the new M5 and the XFR, not too sure which one.
///M5 IS THE BOSS﻿ OF ALL BOSSES
bmw﻿ rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bmw looks﻿ better
THANK i will﻿ take the M///POWER
The C63 AMG would﻿ shit on everything.
The problem with the Jag: It﻿ looks like a Chrysler ....
You simply cant watch a british reviewing a british car. They make it sound like its the ultimate sports car (better than koinigsegg agera r, bugatt v SS,﻿ lambo aventador, ferrari italia...) Nooobs! An Audi rs6 c6 MTM tuned is faster than the Jaaaaag.
Mercedes for the win﻿
The engine was designed﻿ with an automatic in mind, The cars been ruined. I want a manual.
The headlights ruin this otherwise gorgeous car, the face lift is what it should have looked like﻿ from the start
The new Jag﻿ looks even better...but so does the M5.
This is why Jaguar is better than Mercedes﻿ and BMW. They don't make sense like German but, that's what makes it better! That being said they're not as perfect as BMW and Mercedes.
My mom owns the normal XF... I love driving that car, I hate the tech inside of it. It's dysfunctional. You﻿ can't use the GPS while the car is in any gear except park... That defeats the whole purpose of it. It's the nicest vehicle I've ever had the pleasure of being behind the wheel of, but it's far from perfect. -_-
V10 M5﻿ all the way...
I'm sorry to read that. I've received a lot of replies from that post asking how great the car﻿ is. I'll tell you now that it's absolutely horrible. The first week was great, quite possibly the best time I've had with a car but that has all changed. I'm very lucky I live in the middle of the city and can walk everywhere. I couldn't imagine what a pain in the ass this would be if I needed a vehicle for my daily commute. AVOID JAGUAR IF YOU LIVE IN THE US. @withnail555: Best of luck to you
something else made by jag that will be in the shop more than on the road there﻿ cars are such junk and have been for a very long time it even sounds like shit
and wayyyy﻿ too expensive
well,﻿ when top gear likes a car trolls say their biased when they hate it they say they dont like it because where its from, yes i also agree the XFR is a perfect car... maybe not as reliable as the bimmer but who gives a crap about that buying such a car...
M5 is more powerful and technically superior car. But XFR is a great value for﻿ money, delivering almost same power, noise, handling, excitement and luxury.
I got the xfr to do 187 mph on the mile long stretch of the top gear track. On Forza 4. Not so sure﻿ my tuning attempts did it any justice. Couldn't handle the 771 HP from the stage 3 supercharger. Does nothing but spins up clouds of smoke, and just spins out. Using like 20% throttle or less, is its threshold.
i still﻿ prefer the maserati quattroporte, its slower alot less confortable but has the ultimate V8 sound !
@Tommyfungun﻿ actually Lamborghini is... :L Awkward. They're owned buy Audi :L
get your facts straight mate.. IT is owned by TATA of india but tata are only supervising the them atm, not making jags rite now... So india bought jaguar for 2.3 billion...wish they had spent the same amount of money on their education system and AIDS prevention... so that their people dont come to our country where ppl take showers and baths regularly... Sorry i am not a racist but i hate the fact﻿ that indians rub it in our face that they bought jag.... Get over it already!!
english sense can﻿ be good but i still rather want german wahnsinn, because it is more fun
The only people in the World who say that are you Germans. Look at how BMW have fucked up with the keys on all BMW before 2011!!! The BMW 3 series is the least reliable﻿ car in the UK. Stop blowing your own trumpet. the truth is if you are paying 40,000 dollars for a car it will be good Jag or BMW.
the jag its nice, but poor﻿ engineering...
Reliabilty &﻿ durability lad, they cant exceed in that area, its like chinese quality
