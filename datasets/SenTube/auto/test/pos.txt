Definitely a beautiful﻿ redesign. Great review as always. Wish you hosted the top gear U.S show. Those guys are idiots, boring and lack creativity.
That car is simply﻿ beautiful !
nice car id get.......if﻿ i knew the price
that car looks﻿ amazing! Another great review!
Soo nice...sucks to have no money to buy it with﻿ loll
this car﻿ is SEXY!
wow what﻿ a car
That torque﻿ amount at 1750 RPM is crazy as fuck
awesome car!﻿
most convertibles with the top up look plain ugly. This one looks﻿ so sexy!
Holy﻿ shit that thing is beautiful.
Great review. Fun, imaginitive and serious................I love your style!! The car is a substantial improvement over the old one and may even tempt me back to the BMW brand. One disappointment for me is the exhaust, I wish they had used a quad exhaust set up just to give that extra power design effect﻿ i.e. Jag XKR, Merc SL AMG etc. Good work guys keep them coming!!!
Nice design improvement since﻿ "designer" Chris Bangle left BMW. He single-handedly destroyed every car in the BMW line.
I saw one of these on the road﻿ earlier .. It is freaking gorgeous in real life ..
His cars sold really well though, and personally I loved the E92 3 series, and the Z4M coupe, both of which he had a hand in. I even liked the E60 5 series, though i think i like the new F10 a bit more. Design wise, BMW may be better﻿ but performance wise they are getting worse
i﻿ like the older 6 better...but this is beautiful
More BMW.﻿
Very﻿ nice car
Im going to BMW's drive for the U.S.﻿ Olympic team tomorrow. Cant wait to get behind the beautiful car.
Definitely﻿ a good looking BMW after a very very long time.......
IF﻿ GOD IS WILLING I WILL HAVE ONE WITHIN A 2 to 3 MONTHS....THIS CAR IS SEXY
finally﻿ something nice from bmw, truly proud of the company now
I like﻿ the old one design... but that looks cool.
Looks much better than the previous 6, but it's no Jaguar﻿ XK
Dream﻿ car
the older model looked much better but﻿ its still a great car.
damn, that's one fine ass﻿ nice car!
One of﻿ the finest cars on the road right now.
I think the previous model looked better but this one looks expensive. You don't even have to ask, JUST LOOK AT IT. Its obviously a 'rich people' luxury vehicle. If ur driving a luxury car it should look expensive and make poor people like me feel jealous. And this does. Good job BMW.﻿
More BMW.﻿
the interior looks so much better﻿ then the previous gen
I don't like the back of this car but the rest﻿ is GREAT!!!!
I think the previous 6 series looks a﻿ lot better, I don't think this 6 serious looks bad at all I just think they should of put more work into it, but lets see how the M6 will look this time. oh wait? BMW it's not bringing back the V10 engine only V8 too bad =(
Wow this car is﻿ perfect! One day i would buy one!!!
like all new bmw models, wonderful but unfortunatly after the 2003-2010 models, they got me so looking forward for the new models but they didnt﻿ turn as beautiful as i expected them to be, but very nice work!!
the technology is outstanding.... but the﻿ shape for the car.... is just not the best i guess!
beautiful car and great reviews! yep, i just subscribed! particulary like the BMW reviews. As a BMW owner since 1995 i can testify that the quality, styling, drive and handling of these cars are magnificent. My﻿ current car is a 2007 5 series. I had no trouble with it whatsoever. It still drives like new. I live in Norway and the cars here are subject to extreme conditions especially during the winter and i must say i am very impressed with how BMWs holds up!
BMW is﻿ sooooo much better than MB.
European Quality﻿ BABY !!!!!!!!!YEAH I have this car its pure porn
I love the SUBSCRIBE subliminal﻿ message you guys did. also, it's a really amazing car.
YOU CANT BEAT a BMW,........in﻿ the uk all the pakis drive mercs!
This BMW 650i is one of a kind. It is my dream car (though I'd by the coupe version). I must say I really like your reviews Steve. You have your very own style which cleary differs from other shows like Top Gear and Fifth Gear. You just need a breakthrough. Jeremy should be afraid. Greetings from Norway.﻿
Best﻿ looking BMW ever.
next on﻿ my birthday wish
my dream﻿ car is M6 but I'll be more than happy with this!
absolutely love the 6 series (including the M6). my opinion, the best model they got; even above the 7 series ﻿
my new﻿ favorite car reviewer
I thought I was in love with my 2011 3-series.. but now this video﻿ made me think twice.....
What a great car!!!﻿
I have an E46 330i and the only performance item I have is the Signature Motoring performance CAI for about $160. The performance kit adds around 13.5HP on the dyno, sounds freaking great, and installs in under 30 minutes. Highly recommended. -13.5 HP increase -Lifetime filter -SOUND AWESOME -30 min. install time Aside from the power gain, the SOUND is amazing at higher RPM but sounds normal in﻿ regular driving. I'm thinking about added high-flow exhaust next.
Looks like a car they can use for Transformers﻿ 3.. Goddamn a really sexy LOOK!!..
Whats the Soundtracks name and Artist btw !? The Car is awsome would sell my Grandma﻿ for it
Whats the Soundtracks name and Artist btw !? The Car is awsome would sell my Grandma﻿ for it
Whats the Soundtracks name and Artist btw !? The Car﻿ is awsome would sell my Grandma for it
ITALIAN cars the best!!!!!!! FERRARI , MASERATI , LAMBORGHINI , ALFA ROMEO﻿ , ABARTH are the best cars in the world! it's realty!
futuristic focus on a﻿ immediate present.Congratulations for the presentation.Like the car,it's sublime
Italians Do﻿ It Better
GOOD CAR BUT GAY﻿ COMMERCIAL
Post Apocalyptic brilliance and attention to detail sold it to me. Loved the Alfa Romeo badge that actually looked like it had been there for a long﻿ time.
Tata Manza﻿ looks good
sexy﻿ ass car!!
badass﻿ sexy luxury dog.......
I have the new hard top﻿ coupe. It's hot.
Rolls Royce create such beautiful cars. If I witnessed the ANCAP safety tests where they're run into concrete walls at﻿ high speeds, I'd probably start crying.
great car but has a subtle hearse like aesthetic - and interior a bit like Liberace's coffin lining.﻿
Since the Germans are building Rolls Royce (German excellence through﻿ BMW) they have finnally become a work of art, also technically!!!
yes,and VW﻿ brought back the world of motorsport to Bentley, looks like the Germans did a great job
Very very very cool car . It is super . I wish i could need it because i want﻿ to drive it .
Mine was worth﻿ every cent
Man these bikes﻿ are beautiful
Looking great but she needs﻿ some more ground clearance, on those gentle bends she was touching down.
Its a﻿ beeootiful bike but the price is to high for what you get.
I own a 2000 Chief, which turns heads every time. I ride with 8 Harley guys, when we pull up to a diner, people look at mine, Yes, they are over priced. Mine isn't even rubber mounted, and came with no windshield or bags.﻿ And, you can't even lock the front end. It also bottoms out more than any other bike made, because they racked the front end on the early models. But, what a ride. Love those beach bars. Tim Andrew, Connecticut youtube: timandrew1
Its great to﻿ see an old company brought back to life, been reading up on how & why the company went bust; I still prefer the originals but it is good to see that name back on the road! *So how much are they over there, if their so over-priced?
Indians have always been my favorite, just not my﻿ favorite price tag.
nice bike!!!!!﻿
Super Moto....My﻿ Dreams...
They look really nice. But what is different than this tyme around. Have﻿ they done anything new?
i want an indian. some ppl say its an old person bike but i﻿ say its like riding a work of art. so nostalgic
Really am glad to see this company coming back.﻿ Beautiful bike.
I ride in a big group.I have always liked the Indian.My cousin had a 47 all restored.But I cant get over the price.I﻿ might have to stick to Yamaha.At least until I win the lottery.Its too bad they are so high in price.Especially since they are starting out again.Greed must be a factor.Just like Harley.
No fucking shit douchebag. They didn't use﻿ Harley engine either.
indians are so beautiful and are far less common than Harleys. The roadmaster﻿ is my dream bike. im still stuck with my honda but I like it too:)
i like how indian has kept to their roots, harley has lost its sense of direction with its﻿ design a little.
how come jeremy didn't test drive it on advanced more?﻿ or do some awd drifting with the traction completly off??? still... not a bad looking car with an amazing interior! put some good coils on it with some bolt on's and it will def. be a huge improvemnet!
They have a nice engine sound, but the cars are﻿ ugly as hell
My buddy's dad had one of these in fire engine red. It was﻿ a pretty cool car. His 500E creamed this thing though.
Shame that the Volvo 850 T5 is not built anymore... I can't comment on the performance of the limousine-version of that car,﻿ but the estate car was a complete animal compared to all the other estate cars out there at that time.
@Bandosthegod Don't know dude, don't know? & yes, indeed there's enough﻿ above standard Volvo's out there to be deemed worthy.
It's not an﻿ M3 rival, but it's still a damn nice car. If only Volvo made the exterior a bit more exciting, like the old T5s.
Really like the Car! But﻿ the interior is buttugly
Totally adore this car. It looks fabulous and it handles like﻿ an angel. Used to drive this car during my driving lessons but now I got one for myself. Never felt so comfortable while driving in any other car.
It would look fucking amazing﻿ in black.
This is﻿ more comparable to a Saab 9-5 Aero, even though this is probably a bit faster, being it has 50 more hp and I think I heard him say AWD. By no means an M3 competitor.
I guess I'm just a lot more open minded and less influencable by people's opinions and main stream visions than you are. I PERSONALLY believe handling and performance are also very important﻿ next to looks. Because of that I recommend you to drive a S60(R) yourself and find out what I'm actually talking about. I do however have to admit that the color of the car in this video is not attractive at all. A black paint seems to give this car a totally different look allready.
My friends have both cars. I actually prefer the feel of﻿ the S60R interior and overall driving characteristics better, though the S4 is faster and handles better.
maybe s4 is better but need moore fuel... it has v8 not r5 like volvo. I have s60r and in city 13l/km and on highway 9-10l with﻿ 120km/h..
don't know why,﻿ but i've always loved the back end of those volvos, and thats about it
if this s60 had 400hp and a harder suspension, it﻿ could rival the m3..
VOLVO RULES!﻿
tune it right and you﻿ will have a nice street car to surprise people, 'i swear officer its stock'
M3 drivers are almost as annoying as SRT-4 drivers...douchebags are all they﻿ are. Volvowns. For Life.
also you can make it a lot faster, it comes with a BIG KKK turbo, so if you do a simple ECU tune, you can get 340 HP without having an exhaust done... if you don't believe me, type S60 vs M3 and see the results... and it was a regular S60﻿ not an R...
Yes you can get the R﻿ in america. They are nice looking cars but it has no comparison to a BMW M3. The BImmer is a small monster..... But the R is very nice and Bledarboss I know your making fun on the thr volvo fans but... Make sure while making fun you spell your words correctly just kind of makes you look stupid..
The volvo is a good car, but a﻿ bit boring.
Absolutely, its a good looking car but﻿ no way is it an ///M3
HAHAHAHAHAH u dont even no my friend. u dont even no. s60 R 2004, great car﻿ to drive around everyday except winter. but they only make those rims there is no other rim for that car, so you can imagine tires hahah. and when ur mom parks it on a curb every time and peices of the rim are missing. YEAAAAAAAAA
6:04﻿ , It's actually faster than ferrari.
best looking﻿ interior ever! Volvo 4 life!
I got it restamees ans wedziss. Nevertheless it's a great car to drive, a well made chassis, powerful engine and very comfortable which﻿ u won't find all these is a bmw. to be honest, I don't think the s60R deserved the Clarkson's tasteless jokes.
why ? it is﻿ rly good cars
If I was a businessman, I'd rather have a Volvo than a BMW﻿ or an Audi or Merc
agre i thibk tht﻿ a reall nice nad gfast car bth peroblem th all volvos itstht the pot tobig attention for safety huh and i thik it pots not nice imige on sports model bcse it tok out all fun from driving huh......... both i think iots still a great car wth a lot of fun from driving plus a lot of safety too i think volvos arestill the most safe cars in europe right......
I hope you right. Volvo has been on the decline. Sure it has some good models, but nobody in their right mind (except if you are female) buys a Volvo﻿ now. I doubt that the Chinese will save Volvo. They can barely manage themselves, let alone a well established marque.
Are you kidding me? Volvo is one of the 7 auto companies that is actually been increasing sales since 2008. It's increased sales by 40+% And I mostly see﻿ men driving the XC60. And now with the S60 that'll be even bigger help.
wow your a dumbass.... the S60R does not suck yeah its slow compared to all the very exspensive sports cars on that board but it can still spank most stuff on the road that u see everyday. so what are you on about? and the reason why the stig has a black suit on is because that is the first stig from earlier﻿ seasons.
i﻿ love volvos
say what you will about volvos but they have lovely interiors, look at those﻿ seats!!
M3 Drivers...ass holes. Volvo Drivers....smart people.﻿
@allenspedface32 your a bastard. this car is fuckin sick, what r u dissapointed about. . . obviously its not gunna compare to an m3. if i had this car i would shit my pants, i drive a 2002 jetta 1.8t and i friggin love it so﻿ i dont know why your complaining
@allenspedface32 Well you're lucky. That's a﻿ very powerful car that you're getting to drive around. Don't be disappointed with Clarkson's review of it. It's his opinion. Clarkson said it wasnt as good as the M3.. The car doesn't try to be an M3. It tries to be a cheaper alternative to the M3. It's a bloody good car, in all honesty.
@allenspedface32 . it must be nice owning the s60R if its manual. I had a s60 t5 when I went to high school and took out almost every car out. no 3 series﻿ had a chance. volvos gots respect. just prove it to them ;). Im giving up my scion to get the R by the end of the yr lol
You may not like the S60R or Volvo in general, but no one really does until they drive one for a while. I﻿ stomp on a lot of mustangs in my 2000 S70, which has over 200k miles on it. Can't beat a sleeper! For Life.
I had a V70R wagon- great piece of﻿ kit. Point to point a really quick car- and cops just thought I was tootling to golf with the other Volvo drivers.
Volvo is a very good its just people dont see how cool and awesome they are in my opinion better than other brands that just have snoob appeal think honda/acura NSX and﻿ fuck you all volvo haters including clarkson.
i like that car because it has﻿ a 5 cylinder engine, and i love the sound of them engines
im not much a volvo guy but ill﻿ admit i like that R series as a estate car
ummm not really have you driven one? Yeah its quicker than most average sedans like a pontiac grand prix and a chevy lumina, but it is much slower than its competitors. I like the car a lot, i want one in fact, but giving it the credit of being fast is not really being fair. Ive driven that and some of its competitors and my girlfriend owned the v8 audi s4 and it was no contest﻿ in terms of performance. I guess it really just depends on what your benchmark for fast is.
my sister's best﻿ friend just got his car shipped back from colorado. she let me drive it and let me tell you Mr. Clarkson. It hauls. It really fucking hauls and for a swedish car!!
Ok I love top gear. It's easily my favorite show on TV. But I also own this car. A 2004 S60R which does 0-60 in 5 seconds and only gets faster as the speedometer needle keeps climbing﻿ all the way to 155mph, where the governor kicks in. Its handling is astonishing and the interior is stunning. The brembo brakes are massive and amazingly effective. The only con with the car is the turning radius which is about 60 ft. Volvo screwed up with the 18" alloy clearance. XD
great car despite the review, I am a merc and bmw hater so I must say, that volvo is one of my favourite car producers, and this volvo s60r in black, with bumpers and skirts in a more﻿ racingish style, well it does look awesome fyi, that's how I have mine, great car!
Drove a s60 D5 before and he's﻿ not kidding about the seats, by far the comfiest I've ever sat in
actually for an v8 engine...audi s4 is slow as sh**. driven it and it didn't impress me even a little bit. and i know when that when you have a car of that rank, you shouldn't look for the consumption, but at this audi...it's just sky high for the performance it has. if﻿ i compare it to the old volvo 850 t5r...i would choose volvo over an audi anytime.
Sweden﻿ power right there!
Volvos are ment to be a long lasting great riding car and thats it. They were never very good at racing,﻿ like he said buy an audi for racing. And don't tell me i'm wrong cause i've had a lot of volvos and audi.
I like﻿ this car. Just look at those seats!!!!!!!!!! Depite Clarksons complaints, it's quicker and handles better than most American cars here,
Granted, but﻿ you would think that a car designed for luxury city cruising with a dry weight of 3880lbs and almost no performance characteristics, would lose to any 'stang. Great engineering in my opinion.
i know ford owned volvo i could buy a volvo from those years﻿ but id never own one now poor compony, for soo long they had good crash rates but now their gonna be made from tinfoil
Ye the T5s are pretty fast compared to everything els on the road but still not fast, the new S60 T6 AWD is pretty fast with 0-62 in 6.5sec and have a much more sporty chassi compared﻿ to the old one so i hope they test it on the show this autumn.
it was faster then the﻿ ferrari 575, which is quick. just slower than an acura nsx, which also moves about tidely. seems to me you could say safely that the volvo isn't slow at all, right?
Respect the﻿ Volvo. RESPECT IT.
this﻿ car is awesome, but the color is stupid.
I used to work for Audi﻿ and I can assure you that I would take the S60R over the same generation Audi S4. The Volvo S60R completely trumps it in terms of style and luxury. The Audi just feels like a VW with typical horrible stale german interior. Boring boring boring.
Swedish powa!!﻿
It's just a more versatile car than really anything else I can think of. U can take the boss to lunch or pick up grandma at the airport in﻿ comfort mode and dates, then sport mode for urself (reminds me of BMW driving experience) and finally switch it to advanced mode for the jagoffs revving their "sports" cars and generally being able to beat them from my exp. 3 cars in one. Love my R. New 2011 s60 looks great tho, dammit.
i drive a volvo s40 and a bmw 325i The volvo's 5 cylinder provides enough power to feel like you are indeed driving a european car. The sound is pretty good, and the suspension is way better than any american car or a VW BUT the BMW 325i is﻿ a true sports car. it sends you back in your seat a little bit when you push on the accelerator. the 2 times you really feel the difference between the bmw and the volvo is when accelerating on the freeway and when you have to beat a yellow light. BMW wins
I have S60R. To turn the DSTC off, press the button 5 times about 1 second apart... Not exactly hard. And this review does not do the car justice. It's way faster then what they﻿ made it look like.
If you compare 04 S60R to 04 M3, it's very close. 0-60 times are almost identical. Both being around 5.2﻿ seconds. Top speeds are also the same. Also, I can drive my S60R in the winter. I don't think you would dare to do the same with an M3.
Ok i have nothing against a M3 . I own a s60 R grate car . you chip the R and you get 335 hp and 340 torque way more than M3﻿ how much can the M3 get with the ECU upgrade 3 hp at most . Volvo will stomp on the M3 with the tune just ECU tune so don t diss some thing that is so much better !!!!
I've had a S60R and all I can say, it's absolutely fools safe at any conditions - sunny, rain, snow, ice. All the time you've got the feeling that Newton's physics doesn't work anymore, the car just goes where you want it to﻿ go. Should I say, what happens when you drive M3 over limits on ice? Very, very expensive experience...
Of course not.......the BMW M3 is very expensive, very dedicated car, it sucks for everyday used, it has a harsh ride, and is expensive to upkeep....... all that means that is a typical racing car. This Volvo manages so be safer, cheaper, and﻿ more reliable than the M3 and still comes somewhat close. that is a win is you ask me.
I know, the S60 is not a looker, but neither is the M3. I own a Volvo S40 T5 AWD and I love the looks of it, but the S60 is not my favorite. However some people would think is good looking. I invite you to search in youtube Volvo S60 review by gear patrol. It is an informal review but it makes a really good point about the ca,. it is also very funny. Watch it and let me know what you think about﻿ it then. You should also look the one for the Volvo C30 from gear patrol as well.
Also, the S60 has been﻿ redesigned and it looks better now days....... the 2011 is pretty sweet
he was way more impressed with the c30:p But﻿ i love this car also!
m3's are wankmobiles﻿ .. volvo's are cooler
i like volvo safe﻿ cars
I love my Volvo S60 2.4T! Definitely has some interesting Swedish quirks, but nonetheless a﻿ very, VERY good car.
it's still﻿ faster than you'r crapy 15year old car.
I RACED MY VOLVO﻿ S60 R WITH A FRIENDS 2008 ACURA TL-S 6 SPEED. I WAS BEATEN BY HALF A CAR IN THE QUARTER MILE. WE DID IT SWITCHING DRIVERS AND STILL GOT SAME RESULT.
@allenspedface32 Have you seen some of their other car﻿ reviews? These guys trash any car they want, you cant take Top Gear's opinion on a car's performance because they are very biased. The S60R is a very good sports sedan, it may not be able to quite keep up with an E46 M3 but trust me you will be glad you went with the volvo in the long run. I have an 850 T5 and I have driven E36s and I much prefer the volvo to a bmw, even to an E36 M3. My car would be right up the tailpipes of an E36 M3.
The question﻿ is when you chose betwen a Volvo S60 and an Audi s4. Are you look for a fast car or a safe car? I would go for the safe car which is the Volvo. Unless I'm only going to be driving on the autobahn.
I hope you realize they only test performance cars. The S60 no longer has an "R" model, only an "R-Design" model, which is NOTHING like an "R". The C30PCP was the only true Volvo performance vehicle to come out in quite a long time, and they won't even put it in production. Everything else Volvo makes is just rather boring for the show.﻿
do you realize you can never hate a volvo? sure, there are better cars out﻿ there, but their all cars always looks so pleasant and harmless...a bit like saab...
True, and that's their key to success. It's hard to find any weak points on a Volvo other than it is so well made and easy to drive it is boring. Just like Sweden﻿ itself I guess..
my father has an s60r, its quite fast, and corners beautifully. but it makes﻿ really wide turns.
Cuase i work on cars everyday, this fucking 5 cylinder turbo engien has more﻿ potential then a ferrari has!
Ferrari is still cooler than a﻿ Volvo. Even if the Ferrari had no engine in it at all, I would still rather have the Ferrari. I like the S60 R. I think it's great, but in terms of coolness, heritage, and pedigree it doesn't even come close to any Ferrari.
European cars are the best! Asian/American cars are constantly trying to make their cars the same, Euro cars are always trying to differentiate themselves from each other ﻿
the M3 is is less comfortable,whats﻿ the point of buying a luxury coupe if its not comfy ?
When this came out it was﻿ the most advanced sports car in the world.
yes but it's far﻿ cheaper and it's the interior is far better (this is the new one) where as the 3 series interior feels about six years old with out i drive
Call me crazy but I think the atacama interior (that's the orange one you see here) is absolutely beautiful.﻿
I own a volvo s60 and I have to﻿ say it is one of the best I've driven, the turbo is great, and its very comfortable on long trips.
Nothing wrong with the car but everything wrong with the marketing. It's no M3 rival. It's a different kind of car. It is more of a rival for an Audi S4 avant, saab HOT or similar but it doesn't look like it﻿ was ever designed to put lap times in. Sack the marketing men. It's just a nice car with a bit more power.
i love volvo soooo mucchhh﻿
Wasn't it the Polish who cracked the enigma code? Not Sweden...﻿ Love Volvo though, I am a free human being and I am entitled to like whatever I want. So no hard feelings for all the Volvohaters out there.
whenever i drive an﻿ S60R, i keep wanting to believe it is AWD, technically it is.....but damn its sooo front wheel bias and heavy in front....better traction and easier to drive than a high boost S60 FWD..but yes, very understeery. The 3 active chassis control buttons are freakin awesome though, you can feel the difference. The seats are like true racing seats, with a thick Volvo XC70 soft twist. Basically, way better on the highway than a track because of the weight distribution, and tarction
You do realize that Volvo﻿ has been beating Corvettes and Vipers in road course racing in America for years now right?
got me this﻿ beast s60r
Well m3 runs on v8s and v6s﻿ but that Volvo runs on a straight 5!!!
So, it's a very nice luxury car, that smashes just about everything you'd find on the﻿ road. Nice.
"It's﻿ not that fast either...it still ONLY develops 300BHP..." 300BHP will do me, mate. Probably doesn't feel that fast because Clarkson is a fat tosser.
Will Volvo ever take a shot at a real sports sedan? Give us 400 hp, all wheel drive. I always﻿ root for Volvos because I love the sleeper factor and have owned one myself, and I'm always disappointed by their supposed M3 competitors.
Still love you Volvo. Your may not﻿ be as fast as the Germans, but your still quick, just as safe and much cheaper.
If they wanted this to compete with the M3, it should have AT LEAST 75 more horsepower...that is all. But even with out that, I still﻿ want this car.
This is the best Volvo﻿ ever!
It's called Flash Green. Was around just for 2004 and 2005. I liked it but didn't buy one cuz I was afraid I'd get tired of it. My first S60R was silver, the second (2006) Sonic Blue, which was an awesome color. But I did like Flash Green. And, since I'm gay, too, no big surprise. Right jrodigan5? :)﻿
I have a 850GLT best car ever is fast as hell :D﻿
The engine sound of﻿ the T5-R is amazing !
WELLLL SAID!! HAVING HAD A C36 AMG AND NOW DRIVING AN S70 T5 I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THE PERFORMANCE IS PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL,ONLY TIME MY AMG WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IS AFTER 130MPH :) !!!..VOLVOS ARE JUST SUCH AN AMAZING CAR,NEVER GIVEN ME ANY PROBLEMS,SUCH HONEST CARS,I WOULD RECOMMEND A T5 TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A FAST CAR WITHOUT THE RELIABILITY ISSUES...SO SUTTLE BUT DEFINATE WOLF IN SHEEPS CLOTHING,..IVE LOST COUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF CIVICS,EVOS ETC IVE﻿ TAKEN ON A MOTORWAY STRAIGHT!!
In a way it's﻿ a rival and beter, it's cooler car than the M3, much better looking and the interior is a better place to be however i'd still have the M3 it's just the best car the best saloon by far
I'm not madXD!! It just bothers me the stigma people give Volvo's without even driving them. They're very good car just underrated that's all. I mean look at Koenigsegg they make some fast cars and still don't get the﻿ recognition they deserve. It's just my personal opinion.LOL
Well that's not necessarily true either. They're good cars just not as reliable as maybe comparable cars. Volvo's are just more hardy that's all.﻿
Cheaper, more luxurious, actually usable (snow, rain, high altitude, really ANY inclimate weather) and not too﻿ much slower considering. Not bad.
FWD Car and in Sportmode and still just a few seconds after the M3. I think that the volvo﻿ could have beaten the BMW!:)
I like the "Flash﻿ Green Metallic" color.
Hey! I have got one exact colour but different interior colour mine is cream and﻿ every wheel work at different times. Love the car. :)
Typical for the complete pricks from Top gear. I say S60R will blow away the M3 anytime anywhere! I've seen﻿ it!
I﻿ think that Volvo is one of those companies that never really get noticed, but what they make can be really good sometimes.
volvo's﻿ are awesome
I've always﻿ had a soft spot for Volvo
I love this car, I have﻿ a standard one and the seats are the most comfy things I've ever sat in!
YES. Its﻿ my dream car
Volvo is safe, that's it Its not fun in any﻿ way
I got an S60R recently and its the best car ever. I previously had﻿ a Cayman S and I still prefer this car. I wish Volvo would make another.
The S60R is a great cruiser for highway overtaking but﻿ its turning radius is horrible.
Haha the S60 really does help people get better at parking lol. These cars are wonderful but I had a few issues in my 2005 S60. Number one is obviously the turning radius. Second issue is center lock - it proved to be not so reliable. Sometimes when I lock the car, one door (usually the driver's) doesn't lock and remains open unless I﻿ unlock and lock again or lock it manually. Also, once the car locked itself while the engine was on and left me waiting outside. Have you had any of these issues?
The 2005 R (v70) is my parent's but I do know most of the details. It hasn't had any central locking issues at all. The only problems it has had that I remember was a worn angle gear (gear that helps﻿ transfer power to the rear in awd volvos... it's too soft) and just lately the active magnetic suspension had issues, but it was a cracked pin on one of the connectors to the chassis computer, so that was cheap. I have a 2000 v70r and it's central locking is getting dodgy, but mostly from age. :)
The S60﻿ Polestar is sick, but not this
im a true volvo fan.. but the interial in that car﻿ was awful :S
The S60R is a fun car to drive--and without the﻿ bloated price tag most German cars have.
6:00 Anyone else notice that this Swedish family car beat the Italian Stallion Ferrari 575 with the 5.7l V12 by 0.2 seconds?﻿ To me that's pretty good...
Volvo's﻿ sound system are awesome! The Volvo HU-850 Stereo in this model (and others as options) has a total output of 525W. The stereo is just immense for such a small cabin! Love it! Musics of any generation will find it pleasurable to listen to. :)
This car is not ugly, but I﻿ don't think that this is car for US and especially for US man. In Italia they have very narow streets in their cities so small car is a good choice, but not in US, but it is true that this small car would kick ass most of US cars.
Probably 5 dumb a**es who﻿ don't know what Abarth is.
hey those fiats get﻿ a full tank on $20!!
Great car... despite the lack of knowledge of Americans, to them if it doesn't have a V8 and a square lines its not a car... Althought I agree that the girl takes all the attention on this commercial, people will tend to look up for her after the commercial instead of the﻿ car lol.
Nice﻿ car
Oh my god. I love the commercial and that car. Italien car. Italien model. Oh my﻿ god! :-D
How could you make such a boring review on such an exciting car!? Turn off driver aids to correct understeer with oversteer on this uber expensive 1200 hp 4wheel drive monster? Eh... i think not. Not exactly the car I'd be pushing to the limits of cornering﻿ if I had this sort of money
How do you make the fastest car in﻿ the world sound so..... Dull,
some an exciting car and yet such a﻿ boring review. couldn't they have gotten someone with some enthusiasm?
this is my dream vacation﻿ car for 2 ppl (id pack light)
The best﻿ Volkswagen in the world :D
You talk about your own point of view. Those rich people who bought cars like Bugatti Veyron already have what you listed from education to good business planning. For the average person, those machine are dream cars. I﻿ am well aware about the process to get that level of fortune, some people already obtain that. Whether we can afford one or not is none of our business, we are glad to see that kind of machine exists.
@RacerPlanetZX1 The mclaren is a better all around car but the Bugatti is better on paper. And has more﻿ horse power.and a better top speed. Trust me I love mclaren but the facts are facts
Those rims are beautiful!﻿
It must﻿ take more effort to sound that boring about such an exciting car!
This is a Veyron!!! Why am﻿ I so bored!?
of course is fast﻿ with 4 turbo .
@TheDemonPuppeh, The Aventador is sooo nice but a bugatti is a bugatti my dads friend is one﻿ of the few owners here in Sweden and its awesome to be in and drive to, So go for the Bugatti
I like the car, not the Trap!﻿
GM really needs to bring this EXACT car to the states, and it would sell. Build the car here sharing the tech used by Holden and Vauxhall and they'd have an affordable﻿ and good selling GM fanboy car.
As much as I﻿ love this car, It's probably the nicest way of saying this but it looks like it belongs in the car park of a Asda or iceland. Its a bit chavy and it looks cheap compared to the opposing Audi, BMW or Mercedes. Also for what you get, the price is for Mars and the styling has been done by someone either A: from Spanish decent or B: a communist.
Looks pretty good, but there is a different r8 I would﻿ rather have.
Damn why is everyone hating on this car... This isn't trying to be a GTR in anyway so good one, but﻿ no. Its a cross between an 05' GTO and a G8... I think it looks good.
Car looks﻿ great!!
everything about the car is nice except﻿ for the hideous psuedo front end grille
you mean﻿ nice vauxhall > shitty evo
looks﻿ better than the evo
Sorry but the C63 is much more desirable by which starndar???Only a comparison would sort that out,ohhh sorry i forgot﻿ that anything coming from deustchland is good by default.
@sikmeng of course! the C63 will be epic specially in that sexy matte paint but it will also be waaaay more﻿ expensive...
A supercharger with everything needed costs what, 10 grand? On this engine you can easily make 800hp. Highly customizable engine, highly customizable suspension (it's all magnetic, you can set them up to be as stiff or soft as you like with a laptop), and a highly customizable body... No Mercedes or BMW can compete with this﻿ car in that regard, and that's what makes it worth the 50 grand.
YES. The last and 0NLY kick assed ride Pontiac put out. & now they're discontinued. Pontiac G8. Or Holden. My﻿ friend rented it once and gave me the wheel. My first muscle. It turns so nimble, looks luxurious. And it's just screaming. Massive throttle response. & it's standard !! Manual motherfuckers !! Respect this ride !!
Why did Holden further﻿ uglify this (otherwise) freaking awesome car???
a very very﻿ very nice car. me want it.
Great sedan. It looks amazing with all those LED lights and those wheels. I﻿ think its one of the best looking sedans you can buy today, and the seats are great too. This may be Ausse's only export car, but they made sure it was darn good.
Its a bit Bigger, Faster, Better﻿ and cooler than an Evo....not sure if it's cheaper though.
the rear looks﻿ so intimidating, the front however, fugly
Everyone who had the pleasure to own one in the form of a G8 or GTO loved and﻿ appreciated it.
Gotta love the﻿ nuclear rims.
The series one version of the﻿ car looks better than this but it is still a pretty good car!
This guy makes such an﻿ exciting looking car seem boring.
50,000 pound is cheap considering that it sounds like a muscle car, and handles like﻿ a japanese car...the best of both worlds...
Buy a 2011 Mustang for less. May have less features, but your hitting 60 in 4.6 sec. and handling is a little﻿ better.
it can pull off super long power﻿ slides without breaking a sweat...so yes, im pretty sure it does handle like a jap car...also, the evo fq400 cost about the same and has doesnt have as much luxuries, and produce around the same hp..
what﻿ are u talking about! if a car can drift properly, means that it can handle well, its predictable, its sharp, in the real world not everyone who buys a fast car is going to the track, leave alone caring about lap times...i know the evo is fast but thats 4WD...this is an FR car, i mean, what did u expect? M3 cost slightly more and is arguably one of the best drift cars...so its about time someone come up with good competition...
but the VXR8 can't drift properly... a big﻿ pile of white smoke doesn't mean the car can drift properly. Comparing M3 and VXR8? are you joking!? The VXR8 is a very good car in it's own right, but handling isn't one of them.
i never said anything about a big pile of smoke, i dont know how many degrees u can pull off on an M3, but im quite confident this could beat that...also almost every review of experts i watched and read, the cars handling is beyond good...and its not just top gear...but﻿ its alright that u dont believe me...
Pontiac G8...Only better...﻿
I only watched the e ntire video because I hoped this fat idiot would crash the car. and because it's a great car... but it was made boring by this man. PS: I know why the car hasn't oversteered﻿ as it does in, let's say, Top Gear, because this guy is ever fatter than Jeremy Clarkson...and a lot worse (of course)
in Aus, that techno stuff is never advertised.. press﻿ the big pedal, you get big noise and big fast.. sold
V8 in the UK with V-power at £1.40 odd a﻿ litre and set to rise? Fantastic.
for the price of servicing your 451hp c63 amg﻿ you can go a stage 3 cam and tune package for one of these and have around 500hp at the rear wheels, id much prefer that over 451hp at the flywheel of my mercedes
I would admit,﻿ the colour is not that good. But the car as a whole is fucken awesome...'I Just Want One!'
its﻿ got a v8 mate get the back out!
this would kick﻿ a merc's ass
HOLDEN RULES!!!﻿
Pure﻿ Aussie Muscle :) He just needs too learn the real way too drive it
this dude is a useless geek who should go back to his computer games. He saying how its not worth the 50k because you can get a﻿ merc with more hp but he cant even handle the 325kws??he has no idea and he shouldn't even be driving this beautiful car. This is only my opinion..dont hate.
No doubt it is cheap plastic compared to the aluminium/carbon fibre body (which ever one it is), coincidently though it is more expensive to repair than plastic. The big engine in the HSV would be better & cheaper to fix than the M5's engine. Plus with all those functionalities of the gearbox settings, suspension etc, what a waste of time trying to change all that in the M5 whilst I just turn on the HSV and drive off without a fuss. For﻿﻿ simplicity...its a HSV!
Fuel is﻿ expensive in Australia :( This car doesn't drink too much though, its not bad...
Aussie cars are good, In Australia, A Jag is an improvement I would say :D nice car, I﻿ don't own an Australian car
It's just not gonna get anywhere this car, just costs too much. Getting close to an M3 with that price. If it was considerably cheaper than an M3 then maybe people would go for this instead, and it would become alot more popular. Could be a competitor for the evo and scooby, with a few changes. But its just not gonna happen with that sky-high price tag. Shame﻿ actually, doesnt look too bad
Pudgy, a bit strange looking but﻿ ultimately capable enough...and the cars decent too!
i like﻿ the cars looks...it looks like its childishly designed...too many gills and wings everywhere...how often do you get a shouty looking saloon car?? not anymore these days...
not at all. i think it looks great, better then the last gen hsv.﻿ im an Aussie btw.
Great car .... boring presenter tho wtf ,﻿ same dull tone all the way through !!!!!!!!
Mercedes C63 is only a fraction faster and it costs more then this, in any country, presenter is nothing but pathetic.﻿
see world,﻿ Australia makes awesome automobiles
If it were here in the states,﻿ I'd probably buy one. It's a highly desireable car to me.
why﻿ would you get an evo when you can get this
interesting...if only for the historical﻿ value
my﻿ dad owns a rover 800 and its a great car!
For me, The Rover 800 is just﻿ about the nicest car ever. What is it with these 'car snobs' Rover always have made really great cars.
these cars are great i brought 1 for £250 and its better than any corsa or shatso my﻿ mates have got
Idiot, that 'was' a rare car, you could have sold it to an enthusiast for a decent amount of﻿ money.
Rover 75's? You would have to be dead a long time before you would want one of them. They should have been built long before the Rover 800's. Look at a 75 and﻿ they have always looked so outdated from the begining, whereas the 800 was built with a style that still looks good today.
The MK2 800 was a good car and to be honest fixed alot of the problem with the MK1. The 75 is a good car but it's no 800, and yes it was out dated from it's launch just like the 600. The 800 was never out dated except for it's handerling. The 2.0 was the best in class, space was no Grandada beater but it had more then﻿ enough. Even ride and handerling was good till 96 when others moved the game on.
My dad has this car, an 820Si Automatic, and it goes just as well as it did when he bought it, waaaay back in June 1995...yes it had some problems but, to be true, all the cars suffer when age goes on, and especially the newest cars (from 2002 onwards), which are full of electrics, are even more unreliable than the Rover 800 OR, at Least, equal...we aren't looking forward to get rid of the 820, we're gonna keep it as long as it is able﻿ to move!!! Besides, it's a joy to ride, and very beautiful!!
my dad had three 820's. The last one﻿ (a Mk 2) died of death from a relay problem. Absolutely loved all three of them, the Mk 2 was the best though. Dont care what the posh Jeremy says, it was a solid car. Only car that can compare to it is the Land Rover Freelander. BTW, is it just me or do you just feel safer in the 820? P.S: How Jeremy Clarkson has changed :P
yea this was befor mr Clarckson became clever ass, I had a 7 year old Honda accord for 3 years, chore to drive/rust/cluncks and clancks/ & elec faults. bought a 7 year old 800 4 years ago,higher milage, best & most reliable car I;ve had, and﻿ still a pleasure to drive!! puts the Honda to shame!!..........sorry
I thought this video was for a 'Rover 800 Review'! Obviously I got it wrong! Anyway hows your sad 'OLD' 75﻿ doing? Have you sold it yet? I've still got my 800 Coupe. and I'm keeping it.
Nice to hear from you again nomiwilts. Thanks for being so honest with your car ownership update, I guess I won by keeping my﻿ car (should have my 800 coupe for some years yet). Enjoy your 7 series, that must be so stuffed with features, and all the buttons for them all! A bit to complex for me, but I bet the ride is good.
In the engine bay theres a box on the passenger side. It contains three (sometimes four) relays. Once the engine started it was fine. Then one relay would start flickering, the engine would start to splutter﻿ and it'd die. It was probably a problem with the EMU, but we never found out. Although I have seen the car since driving around perfectly. But the current owner has disgraced the car by putting a tow-bar on it :(
I see... my dad's Rover 820 (1995 model) is quite nicely hold due to my dad never leaving it out of service. It has 273,500 km written on, but still﻿ goes like if it were new. Shame about your dad's latest Rover, it is a gorgeous car to have, and to drive. That's all I can say about it...
Weirdly, the Germans and even the Italians liked the styling... It was the first Brit car to win the Golden Steering Wheel Award. Just days later Rover 75 was voted The Journal/AA Car of the Year. A panel of leading Italian and international automotive experts also declared the Rover 75 the World's Most Beautiful Automobile - High Class Saloon (1999 or 2000).. I can give you the sources to﻿ prove it.
The old﻿ Legend and the Rover 800 were brilliant cars. Great engines, great performance, great style. I buy a 800 a million times above a 75 ;)
I don't know why, but I've always found﻿ the Rover 800 Coupe quite attractive.
they are a lovly looking car the coupe, i have too keep talking myself out of getting﻿ one for my next car, a lot of car for the money these days too also you might be interested in this video.
The 800 is the ONLY rover I﻿ like.
clarkson talking outta his backside.... the rover is the biggest car there﻿ and much better looking then the alfa only the beemer there is as good as the 800
You know when they say 'Dont judge a book by its﻿ cover', well the same for cars like this. Dont judge by its badge....JUST LOOK AT IT FOR GODS SAKE, looks much better then most more expensive cars out there these days. WELL DONE MAZDA!!!
Very nice review. Mazda is a great﻿ company. You get a lot for your money!
You'll never get fat American SUV drivers to shove their ass in this nice little car.﻿
maybe it is usefull in warm and big citys like Rom, or﻿ Paris
They should make﻿ it look more sporty and cooler, very good idea though.
well i think it's a great car for city. ecpecially if﻿ goverment supports for ev cars
a﻿ great car ... ... for a golf course.
Very good for a city like Paris﻿ ... just put doors x)
as﻿ soon as it comes out ill just go and steal one ... no dors WTF??!!
It's a good conceptual car, but as an actual daily﻿ road car, it's not very good or practical.
I﻿ would need doors to use it here in Montreal. Apart from that I like it a lot.
golf cart killer﻿ xDD
this is more of an updated﻿ golf cart.
No, if American's bought cars like this, then people would have to work closer to home. This would've created demand for well paying jobs in the suburbs. America would be spending money on creating jobs, the infrastructure to support it, and not on terrorist﻿ oil. Crisis averted!
Renault has wide range of cars, and Formula 1 is just﻿ a way for them to market their technological know-how and thus sell more cars. As petrol is getting more and more expensive expect to see more of these, or hybrids.
No different than if you are in a scooter or small commuter car that runs on petrol. Want to feel safe? Buy a tank and drive around in that. On the other hand you can be a little more careful in traffic and have a little more faith in﻿ truck drivers, who cause way less accidents than other motorists.
In some European countries they pay almost $10 per gallon. Suddenly it makes a lot of more sense doesn't it?? Like it or not, oil is getting more and more scarce. You'd best pray the Chinese doesn't buy a million new cars every﻿ year or it's running out even faster. Naturally the Chinese aren't dumb and look the future, therefore they have invested a lot in new green technology. Sometime Detroit wouldn't do in a thousand years. Thanks the arabs for their cheap oil btw.
Never been a fan﻿ of Renault or electric cars, but I actually think that this will be quite the hit. Opposing to a Prius, it actually makes sense.
I think the design﻿ is pretty cool, but at least throw some light weight doors on it for rain purposes
Great idea. Cheap to buy, inexpensive to﻿ run, easy to drive, park. Room for 2. This is exactly what europe needs... Well done Renault.
i spend 100€ in gas every month just to go from home to college so leasing batteries for 45€ is rigth for﻿ me
now﻿ i know what to buy for my grendpa's present
looks more modest, wished﻿ it still had the silver wheels though :p
To the shitheads who complain about the looks of this car: well, what are you going to do? Oil is simply not practical. It simply costs too much:﻿ pollution, massive corporate-military-welfare to sustain it, causing global warming that destroys crops and causes food to be more expensive.
AWESOME﻿ COOL CAR!
@spaceinvader79 this is more a scooter than a car...however, in europe there is no suvocrazy, so we'll buy﻿ it here.
i really think that this is a little bit more practical﻿ than an aventador.
you speak shite,this is better than my mountain bike to drive﻿ and that mean is beeter than an aventador
Nice 'car'﻿
Driving﻿ a Gasoline Car﻿ is embarrassing.
I'd buy this for fun. Its probably very fun to drive around small towns and villages.﻿
that is a nice power chair ﻿
Faster than it looks to be﻿ honest i'm im
car of the future. ﻿
I need﻿ car , This is my choice!
Yeah you're right electric cars wouldn't suit areas like yours, they're more so made for big European cities like Rome, Paris, Berlin etc. I live in Ireland and I wouldn't see any use for it here either though, our roads are narrow, but quite long and our main cities like Dublin, Galway and Cork are too﻿ small to even bother using city cars like this. It seems to be a very hit and miss car really :L
"they are not practical" - Something like this is VERY PRACTICAL in Tenerife when combined with a solar carport and a second set of batteries. As long as it incorporates its own charger﻿ for "emergencies"...
I'm all for electric cars and﻿ I think this is great... But it NEEDS doors. Not practical in rain.
Proof? This is Renault we're talking about. And Smart, years ago made their ForTwo a 5 star EuroNCap car because it used a high strength cage that could protect the occupants in a collision with a C Class. Renault obviously has one, they said it and the ''car'' weighs 450kg, the batter is 100kg.﻿ BUT a side impact would scare and fuck me sideways.
I like but what would happen, let say,﻿ if starts raining?
its﻿ cool for city driving but thats it.
Fun on the road!!﻿
Rather great car!﻿
good to﻿ jump to grocery store however if u get hit? ...portable coffin
That's pretty cool﻿ :D Too bad something like that would be illegal and too slow in the states.
really interesting car. in Italy with this car you will pay 1€/50 Km (so Renault says) with a monthly 50€ for battery leasing. With a﻿ current cost of gasoline of 1.7€ /litre (about 8.35 $/gallon, highest in﻿ EU), this could be a real alternative.
looks fun. And the range would be enough for most drives. i don't understand comments, that say, this is not a serious car. Whatever you call it:﻿ it don't make sense to travel i a car with 3000kg weight to transport just one person with 80kg... so small cars like this will be the future. although the don't offer every usage we're used to
I like the basic concept and design and am very tempted. However without doors it is, in practical terms, a no,no. Some years ago I had﻿ a Mini Moke with a roof, but no doors, which meant that when it rained I was soaked in quick time.
See I like it and would drive around town in it. If everyone else did. If not you're just asking to﻿ die.
Looks good, do you get door covers in case it rains?﻿
What if this, what if that. Go back to the tree and eat bananas! Because what if you climb down and a lion eats you, right? There is an invention called the MOTORCYCLE for the last 100 years, I dont know if you know about that at the cave you are living. So yoru argument is STUPID. These little electric cars are MORE safe and SLOWER than a motorcycle that has NO SAFETY AT ALL. That﻿ didnt stop motorcycles to win the entire world. Grow a brain, stay at home or buy yourself a tank, idiot!
I think these are going to catch on in a﻿ big way all over the planet - cheap enough to compete with a 2 wheeled machine (just about) but with none of the main disadvantages - weather and danger ('soccer-moms' permitting). I predict they will take over from the petrol scooter as the transport method of choice for young, cool busy youths as well as independent-thinking commuters. And all for a ha'penny a mile (excluding the rent of the battery).
it will be amazing to see these hit the cities and towns, i would get one myself maybe in a few years, but i wouldnt like to drive this with much larger cars and trucks around you still running off fuel. if streets where covered in these little twizy cars and other fully electric cars﻿ it would make such a difference to the environment and would make driving so much safer it would be unreal. Damn i love technology
afcorse it﻿ handles good in corners it goes only 45 :S
Thats all well and good when you're at home if thats the case. I'm talking about being able to charge the car whilst you're out and about, hence me saying that there isn't any charging posts in the city I live in. There needs to be more investment in the national infrastructure so that﻿ people can charge their cars when they're out and about too!
I have seen this one at our local Renault seller. I﻿ like it, but it has no side windows! (don't like that!) The price is around 10000Euros, the battery is on leasing. I think it has a chance!
better getting hit﻿ in a twizy than on a scooter
Think you're missing the point. This is designed for city use - 47mph is enough for any road in, say London, and the instant torque plus low weight (about 1/3 of a﻿ standard hatchback) means they're actually quicker off the mark than you might think. It's better to think of it as a slightly safer and more comfortable scooter than comparing it to a car.
I've actually booked a test drive in one in a few months so I might be a bit biased. Got a BMW as my main car, but this looks ideal for getting to work and back during the﻿ week for me.
this car was a prototype the real twizy is nicer with colors ...2 doors ...2﻿ seats
that is the most funniest looking car ever. it's also the shittiest in my﻿ opinion.
I drove this car today - brilliant, so much fun and practical! Only down point - the doors. The standard model comes without ANY doors. You pay £545 for a half a door. The top of the door were you would expect a window to be is empty. Not suited to british weather, but barr this I think a good buy. 90p to charge it from empty to full, no road tax, £240 insurance, big savings﻿ to be had!
One of the coolest, fun cars on the﻿ market
Going to﻿ work without spending gas? SHUT THE FUCK UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Why are they calling this a car? Even﻿ by golf cart standards thing sucks. Notice that the gov has to pay for half of it with your tax dollars so it has even a small chance of being viable.
Better than a motorcycle! ﻿
I would buy this car but i live in the states and all the people with the hummers and chevys﻿ will mock me.Although you know what they say about people with small cars ;)
COOOOOOOOL! Could do with a pair of doors. I mean with the state of britain these days I wouldn't feel safe leaving the thing﻿ on the pavement!
Did you know.. Electric cars use 85% of the energy put into them to move. Conventional cars use only about 25% of the﻿ energy put into them to move. The rest is wasted in things like gear changing, exhaust fumes, engine heat, breaking etc.
does anyone know how long it will be before all cars are electric? because I﻿ like electricity as an option, but i also love gasoline cars.
People don't seem to get it. It's a run about car﻿ for the city or short commutes. Lots of families have 2 cars this would be ideal for hem
I like the look﻿ of this but loaning the battery just sounds like a con
Compressed natural gas? Well i would not be able to use it at all seeing as there﻿ is no where within 100 miles of me to fill it up. I would really like an electric car, but they just are not quite there with the range, cost and performance yet :(
better than﻿ a bike
yeah that's a little expensive electric cars will get much cheaper once we run out of oil.﻿
Great news - You can﻿ get now windows for Twizy : Rigid Windows Rain Stopper Renault Twizy
There are plenty crash tests of the Twizy on YouTube, and many people are offering all kinds of rain-protectoin as zip or pop on windows on the doors, commonly seen on microlights.﻿ /user/TwizyRainStopper
Its a clever idea but i would not want one it looks nice and safe on the crash tests but it probably would not stand a chance if a normal car hit it. we have not seen an accident yet but just wait the law is changing in the uk but i am glad to hear that with new rules from next year a 16 year old will need to do the full theory test & , CBT and another form of testing.﻿ but the big things are the insurance its not going to be cheap.
I am a Twizzy owner (with doors). Live on top of a mountain in Wales. Done over 800 miles so far. a. This is a rural vehicle for all those short jouneys us country livers do b. You don't get wet when it rains unless there is a sideways gale + force 5 c. Its very cheap to run d. It causes reactions when you drive - men show obvious fear that if it spreads its going to damage their verility in some way women all love﻿ it. Apprarently they have sold many thousands - so go for it give it a try!
It would be nice if﻿ they would not make electric cars look so stupid.
Cool! It's﻿ a freakin' transformer! :) (jk)
I want one! In Australia! But I would like a small trailer to hook on the back that contains a small petrol or diesel generator that can charge the car while driving to extend the range as long as the﻿ fuel tank is topped up. Sort of a hybrid option.
Now they offer windows as well for another 250 Euros, which you can supposedly assemble yourself. Now you can drive it in the winter too! :-D I love this pretty little thing!! But they shouldn't make people rent﻿ the battery, that's just a rip-off...and they should offer prettier patterns and colours, too, like flowers or rainbows and stuff.
looks light and nimble.﻿
as would I, jaguar always has a place in my heart. a place﻿ that BMW cannot fill
Manual or not,﻿ a BMW M5 is just such an awesome car. Jaguar did a truly awesome job with this one, but the M5 is more my style.
this﻿ jag is a beast!
Theres waaayyy too much bias here. Ive had the pleasure of driving﻿ both and the jag is good, but its not as good the M5. The turn in is really slow and you have to get on the power really late when you exit a corner. Also, those fancy rotating AC units? They get stuck from time to time.
common man, bmws﻿ are too used and common... drive a jag and watch the people starre at you
i would so take the jag﻿ instead of the m5
hold 5 for car tbag﻿
the﻿ Jaguar name has a long history so it is good to know the new owners are committed to making a beast like this, Awesome indeed
I'll﻿ go with that superb V10...Thank you!
That doesn't make it an Indian car, you fool! In addition did you see Sundays Top Gear, Jaguar are getting﻿ good with the "British" built Jag using Indian ownership. I have also owned a M5, never again, nothing but trouble, don't always believe what you read in the mags! You cannot also criticize India (that was a nasty thing to say) because along with China are the greatest advancing car markets in the world. They used to say Jap cars were crap, now they make the most reliable cars
The 5 series is many things. Spacious is not one of them. That interior is﻿ as cramped as can be. Fun as hell though1 =D
Jaguar peak of perfection, idealism﻿ and the class of so aggressive souls! something beautiful!
The Jag is catching up, only good news and﻿ hopefully the next gen jags will get even better!
My moms boss owns of those and she took it for a drive(I took it out﻿ when everyone was sleeping) and its an awesome car
I don´t think Top Gear is biased at all. I think they are generally pro Ferrari Porsche and BMW. I﻿ think they are fair on Jaguar and this XFR looks like a great car. My Mercedes S350 has been a disappointment - 24 days in the garage in just under 2 years. For facts about reliability the JD Power data is what you should look at, and Mercedes is a pretty poor performer

I totally agree with you german and jap cars are great and they are very reliable but im guessing from you comment that your an american (always putting British down), and im sorry but British cars are great. Have you ever seen a bmw x5 get to the top of a mountain, no but﻿ you can see a rangerover do it. And just looking at an Aston Martin makes your legs shake from its beauty compared to a Japanese quad core processor on wheels. Plus British unreliability is in the passed.
I agree however now Jaguar has been bought﻿ out the reliablity should increase.
i think you'r right but at the same time the new jags are soo much better than the older﻿ generations
i love Jaguar XFR﻿
I love this Jaaagggghgg!﻿
I love bmw's, I think they are almost perfect and never liked the idea of a Jaguar... ...but I﻿ love this car.... the noise, the v8 grunt, beautiful...
I choose my cars by design and not by their performance because nowadays all cars have a decent amount of power to drive inside the city and in our freeways, and im not rich to spent money on a car that consume a lot of gas!! so i would get the jag, great lines indeed something refreshing in﻿ the jags, in the bmw its the same old design, and thats getting boring!! cumpz to all car lovers
my favorite jag. just a gorgeous car inside and out, they finally got it right at jaguar as I never was a fan﻿ of jags up until this car. It would be a tough decision between this and the m5
honestly.. if i had﻿ to choose between the 2 cars.. i'd have the jag... its just beautiful.. whereas the m5 looks like someone kicked it repeatedly..
jag for me﻿ ...:))
I'd﻿ choose the Jag any day!
who needs commentary when you﻿ got the sound of a supercharged V8 ...
Jaguar is amazing﻿
id take this over an M5. the only sedan i﻿ think id prefer over this is the RS6
I would get the M5 but the Jag is also﻿ good.
awsome﻿ car, but i prefer the Mercedes E63 AMG.
cool car, but it was still rated for dependability at 143% below average, in other words it's a peice of﻿ shit and always breaks down
don't forget that it still is a saloon with a front engine... it's fast﻿ in a straight line but "struggles" to be as sharp as sportscars such as ferrari, porsche etc through corners...
I love this car....British cars are﻿ just iconic!
throw on an amg kit and ya got﻿ one of my dream cars
Same as﻿ everyone else...maybe the BBC could check the sound levels before uploading a vid... Anyway, great car!
A supercharged engine that doesn't have that terrible supercharger﻿ wine is a winner to me.
stop crying and listen to the music﻿ of this JAG !!!!
I love that jag so much. If I win the lottery I'm going straight to the dealer﻿ ship. Lol ; )
that﻿ was fantastic, what a jaguar .. really a monster :D
LOVE THE NEW﻿ JAAAAAAAAGGG
It may have been designed when the company was owned by Ford, but for﻿ all intensive purposes it's a TATA. However, regardless who's it's made by, it's a superb vehicle.
Superb Vehicle=//= TATA﻿ & Ford
i like the jag﻿ more..
@Jaguar:4 the love og God PLEASE re-design the headlighs when the mid-life,facelifted model comes out!﻿ It looks GREAT from 3 angles.......
So far Tata motors has done a great job with this new jaguar, much better than ford﻿ did
Congratulations, Tata! This is﻿ such an amazing car.
Absolutely stunning Jag, being 0.5secs slower then the M5 doesn´t really mean a lot considering﻿ that the Jag is way softer to drive and much more quiet then the M5. Put a stiff suspension on the Jag(like the M5) and you can easily get a sec or two off the time. And the crown goes to.........Jaguar :)
Jags are pure style﻿
Yes, from﻿ the styling alone, it looks so good with that boomerang tailamps, focused headlights, huge grille, and elegant waistline....
The Jag looks better and I would﻿ buy it before the M5!
The Jag sure looks better than the﻿ M5.....
I love the Jag only problem is that it isn't british... anymore its owned by﻿ tata motors an Indian company
It's uncannily comfortable... unless you're sitting in the back seat. My buddy has an XF and it truly is a beautiful thing, but if I wanted a two seater...﻿ Why doesn't Jag actually make the rear seat comfortable?
lol, he loves it because it's british of course.﻿ I would too.
I'm not British and I absolutely love Jaguar. BMW is a world class car but it doesn't have the soul of Jaguar. I only wish that Ford hadn't sold them to Tata. Some wealthy Brit needs to buy them back before Tata moves production to India or China. The current﻿ Jaguars were designed during the Ford days, there is no telling what might happen now.
at least the XFR doesnt have the annoying iDrive that BMW has.... uuuugh i used to own﻿ a 6 series and it got SO annoying i traded it in for a XF Premium few months back. best choice i ever made, the jag is smooth and very fun to drive
The ultimate beast that m5 :) Like the Jaguar﻿ too, it looks so nice from the back
Even if I had to push it all﻿ way long, I wud buy Jaggg for its design over dirty BMW anyday! Period!!
The Jag is the nicer looking car. Would choose it over the M5 if I﻿ was fortunate enough to have that dilemma!
The Jaguar has﻿ one of the world's best looking contour, better than the stupid looking old M5, though it has improved on the new one. The XF and the XJ. What baffled me is why Jag even bothered to release a racing version. Race it, you'll never beat M Series.
my favorite﻿ car ever
I'd have the﻿ Jag anyday over m5.. awesome <3
jag﻿ looks better
Votes for Jaguar XFR!﻿
I vote for the XFR because it's the best car in its current class. The E-Class is ugly, far too common, has a consistently boring colour, despite its trim, the BMW also, looks far too common, seen at least a million in the past year, showing BMW's quantity for quality "technique"... The Jag however, love its Aston Martin type rear end, the front appeals to a person like me also. Love the fuel consumption, sexy interior, sexy EVERYTHING. Jag for﻿ me. The rest can sod off.
I bought the Jaguar - it is an outstanding car -it is pure class with all the spped -BMW very good -the jag just has such class﻿ in business -this is perfect.
BMW is a better car, but the Jag is a JAAAAG﻿
now all they need is another e-type﻿ baby! seriously if you love cars, you have to love Jag, Caterham and of course Alfa (rwd gta's).
Hm, we'll have to disagree, the jag has better handling and acceleration (slightly though) And its cheaper,﻿ thats all it takes to convince me. But I guess thats a matter of opinion
BMW handles better and is accelerates faster as shown in the video, until a point it hits the limiter. It is cheaper, but I don't﻿ really care about that. I would get the Jag though, but the new M5..that would trash the Jag, and between the new M5 and the XFR, not too sure which one.
Handling wise, they﻿ are on par. The M5 has always been the powerhouse, until now.. The modified XFR will destroy any M5 going. We even trashed an 550i with our 3,0 S model.
Not to mention, the MPG on this car, especially the newer ones, exceeds 52.5 mpg, that﻿ means you can go to Brussels, to England, on one tank. Also the XFR destroys the F10, M5, in terms of speed. The m5 is a vulgar, disgusting, BMW standardized. AKA Crappy.
It is, seeing as the XFR handles like a dream, it feels alot lighter than the BMW and has a great reaction time. Even though the BMW has a better Gearbox (no surprise really since BMW's﻿ gearbox reputation) the Jag' (especially the new version of this pretty) outruns most other of its competitors in tightcorner tracks,while maybe have to struggle in less cornery races. So yes; it IS a matter of opinion.
BMW is good cars, I love their Gearboxes, but with the newer XFR on the market with much higher acceleration and Torque, the BMW's competing with it simply cant pull it. And besides; the Jag is cheaper. Im going for﻿ the Jag really, its prettier, handles like a wet dream and is awesome.
used to want an M5 ... until now! Jaguar is my﻿ new dream
If you want to try to be somebody? You buy a BMW. If﻿ you ARE somebody? You buy a Jaguar. Nuff said...
Out of all the tuned Sedans the CTS-V rules all, but I﻿ love the Jaaaag.
thumbs up if﻿ u woooooooood get the JaaaaaaaaaaaaaG!
wow! the jaguar is magnificent!﻿
The Jag will always look better than a BMW, IMO the only other saloon car that can compete is an﻿ A8
And the Audi is hideous. I'd take the Jag over that any time﻿ of the day. Any Jag over any Audi, for that matter. And I'm not british.
Well it obviously is a great car, didn't you see the lap time? half a second slower than one of the fastest saloon cars ever made. And why are you comparing it to hyper cars? are you mad? And an Audi rs6 mtm tuned is not faster than an XFR The XFR unlimited has hit speeds of 225mph at﻿ the Bonneville salt flats. Its a Unknown fact that Jaguar make the some of the best cars in the world
Shit, this car is amazing... And﻿ the 2012 facelift is even better.
I dont have the XFR BUT the Xf in any form is a joy. I have the 2.7﻿ and even after a year I am like a kid at Xmas. Long may that continue!!
I am in love with this﻿ car. It's breathtaking.
The new Jag﻿ looks even better...but so does the M5.
This is why Jaguar is better than Mercedes﻿ and BMW. They don't make sense like German but, that's what makes it better! That being said they're not as perfect as BMW and Mercedes.
Only reason im buying this car is because Jaguar is now Indian owned. If it was english owned i most definitely would not have even thought about buying it. Cant wait to grad from uni, this is the car im buying﻿ the day i grad.
My mom owns the normal XF... I love driving that car, I hate the tech inside of it. It's dysfunctional. You﻿ can't use the GPS while the car is in any gear except park... That defeats the whole purpose of it. It's the nicest vehicle I've ever had the pleasure of being behind the wheel of, but it's far from perfect. -_-
I have the V6 3.0 S, and it's the best car I ever had (similar colour to the test XFR!). Did blow the intercooler last weekend at 42K miles, but all handled very efficiently﻿ by Jag under warranty. The new BMW 5 is uber competent but sooo drab, and the new CLS looks like a pig compared to the previous model. Will be the facelift XF next time for me.
Man﻿ good stuff! I hope to be a Jaguar XFR or XKR owner once i graduate from University. The reason why im buying it, is because its Indian owned :)! Fucking nice.
M5=Laptop﻿ Jaaaaaag=sex
I﻿ love the sound this thing makes.
71 people own a bmw﻿ and wished﻿ they bought a jaaaaaaaaaaaag
This car is just easier to live with in my opinion.﻿
Love﻿ that xfr way better than an m5. Because of the way is sculpted. Its just beautiful.
I've just got my XKR after suffering weeks of agony, waiting for it. I've been driving with the windows down to﻿ max out the noise and I'm going to need a new set of boots within about another fortnight. It's feckin great. Enjoy......
XFR best car in the wotld but has to be in British﻿ Racing Green, best colour in the world on the best car in the world
i get what you mean but im asian and yes im a MASSIVE top gear fan so you can say i always defend top gear but british cars are amazing too, their not reliable but they are absolute dreams on wheels, yes an M5 like he said is an amazing driver's car but that doesnt mean the XFR﻿ cant take it on, i LOVE M5s but the jag is just too damn sexy
I love the XF even though im not﻿ the worlds biggest Jag fan, ive always been more into Aston's.
my cousin has one never rode in it but from what ive seen in this vid shits﻿ awsome and looks damn good in her driveway lol shame she prolly doesnt drive it like she should
I really don't care if Tata own's Jaguar and Land Rover, As long as Jaguar and Land Rover make's quality vehicles then it's Okay. If Tata Didn't bought Jaguar and Land Rover in the first place then the 2 car brands would be extinct by now and we wouldn't be seeing range rovers and XJ's on the road﻿ would we.
I've driven a XF, its a cool fuckin car﻿ end of story!
Would rather have the XF rather than the﻿ BMW!! I mean, the 5 series is soooo ugly!!!!!
Tata are the biggest steel company in the world. ﻿ They will probably supply top quality metal to Jaguar for building the cars ;-) Plus Tata have an expert metallurgy department. Tata are a fantastic owner for Jaguar, the technologies compliment each other.
Yes but none of those cars covers the breadth of ability that a Jag XFR does. The XFR's ability to drive 99% as well as an M5 and then﻿ cruiser with 99% of the refinement and comfort of an XJ is, in my opinion, almost completely unmatched by anything else. Every car you mentioned there, without exception, is fantastic on track but hardly comfortable and practical. I really can't think of anything that covers both bases as well as an XFR. So yes, I think it is pretty much perfect.
well,﻿ when top gear likes a car trolls say their biased when they hate it they say they dont like it because where its from, yes i also agree the XFR is a perfect car... maybe not as reliable as the bimmer but who gives a crap about that buying such a car...
M5 is more powerful and technically superior car. But XFR is a great value for﻿ money, delivering almost same power, noise, handling, excitement and luxury.
beside the point ... lol its sill bought by tata and if they wanted to do the engineering behind it im sure they would be more then capable to do so .. why are people taking such offense to me﻿ mentioning its Indian they're a booming economy. And ive had delivery of the XF and its a beautifully manufactured car.
Yeah, that is exactly what I am thinking. I think the Jags have more charm than﻿ any BMW, Mercedes or Audi would ever have!
@Tommyfungun and Jaguar IS INDIAN Get over it jeez. They're﻿ fucking amazing, oh btw do is Land rover too :L boohoo even range rovers and landrovers are better.
It's a press car. They tweaked the limiter. ﻿
The Jaguar XF is one of the sexiest cars on﻿ the planet. It is just [censored]ing gorgeous beyond belief. Hotter than any Benz saloon on the market today, definitely sexier than any of the ugly ass BMWs on the market. I'd even take it over an Audi, and I frigging Love Audis.
i'll take﻿ the jag over a bmw any time
I love﻿ jags
Jag.﻿ No doubt.
the jag its nice, but poor﻿ engineering...
I'd take that JAG over any﻿ BMW.
I Think i've﻿ fallen in love with Jaguar...
More comfortable, easier to drive and use, cheaper, better looking, better built, less embarrassing, faster 0-60, more torque, cheaper to fix... And it's just as good. Right. To heck with logic.﻿
